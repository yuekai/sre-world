"""saleor-spine grading hooks — the substrate-owned capture/postprocess layer.

Peer of substrates/frappe/grader_hooks.py. The minimality config-diff basis is
the three vendored CloudPirates subchart configs, each rendered into a
release-independent ConfigMap (fullnameOverride):

    ConfigMap ``postgres``         key ``postgresql.conf``  ->  sut/config/postgres.yaml
    ConfigMap ``valkey``           key ``valkey.conf``      ->  sut/config/valkey.yaml
    ConfigMap ``rabbitmq-config``  key ``rabbitmq.conf``    ->  sut/config/rabbitmq.yaml

Two conf formats: ``key = value`` (postgresql.conf, rabbitmq.conf) and
``directive value ...`` (valkey.conf). Both parse into semantic dicts under a
top key (``postgres`` / ``valkey`` / ``rabbitmq``) so the oracle's dotted-key
differ sees ``postgres.statement_timeout`` — matching the ground-truth
namespace 1:1.

RUNTIME OVERLAY (the saleor-spine twist): repairs here happen through the
infra services' REAL admin surfaces (ALTER SYSTEM + pg_reload_conf, CONFIG
SET), which never touch the rendered files. ``collect_runtime_snapshot()``
(called by the sidecar at declare) captures non-default ``pg_settings`` via
``current_setting()`` (SHOW-format, unit-compatible with conf literals), and
``build_config_after`` overlays those onto the rendered basis — so an
ALTER SYSTEM repair (or a wrong-knob "fix") is a REAL diff key, not invisible.

Consumers (both load THIS file — single source, no drift):
  * tools/generate_tasks.py (manifest ``generate.config_hooks``) ->
    :func:`render_config_before` (stamp-time config_before + fault-landed check).
  * substrates/saleor-spine/loadgen_sidecar.py (staged as /app/grader_hooks.py)
    -> capture_sources / collect_runtime_snapshot / build_config_after.
