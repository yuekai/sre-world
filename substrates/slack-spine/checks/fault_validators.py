"""slack-spine per-tier fault-overlay validators (substrate-owned).

The task generator (tools/generate_tasks.py) dispatches here via the manifest's
``generate.fault_validators``: these checks know THIS chart's values schema
(app.roles.<role>.{db,env,mesh}, faultInit.db.*), so they live with the
substrate, not in the shared tools. Both FAIL LOUDLY (SystemExit) — a
misauthored spec must die at generation, never ship a subtly-wrong task.

    validate_layer(spec, sub)         — Tier-2 per-task fault LAYER confinement

#   2. roleGuc — faultInit.roleGuc.*, a post-install `ALTER ROLE <role> SET <guc>`
#                landing in pg_db_role_setting. The healthy chart already ships
#                one of these (tier06.yaml's 10-app-role.sql sets the app role's
