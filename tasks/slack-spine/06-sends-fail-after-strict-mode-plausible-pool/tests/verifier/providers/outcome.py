"""The outcome gate.

Computed over the SOAK window (loadgen records whose phase startswith "soak"),
using calibration/band.json per-phase p99 bands when present, else the
manifest's provisional thresholds.

Checks (conjunction a..e):
  a. latency:    p99(soak.peak) and p99(soak.trough) within band/threshold
  b. error rate: (pool_timeout + error + timeouts) / non-dropped <= error_rate_max
  c. goodput:    (ok AND correct) / offered(non-dropped) >= goodput_min_ratio
  d. saturation: pool_wait_p99_ms (from metrics.jsonl scrapes in soak) <= max
                 — CONDITIONAL: only when manifest.thresholds.pool_wait_p99_ms_max
                 is set (pool-exhaustion-specific, 03-F1). XID scenarios omit the
                 key and the saturation check is skipped entirely (§5.3).
  e. services_up + restart legitimacy (docker_state.json + config diff presence)
  f. lane_health: kafka_consumergroup_lag GAUGE max (from async_metrics.jsonl,
                  the loadgen sidecar's service-metric scrapes) per lane <= max
                  — CONDITIONAL (mirrors saturation exactly): only when
                  manifest.thresholds.lane_health is set AND async_metrics rows
                  were produced. The 6 prior scenarios omit the key and scrape
                  nothing, so it is DORMANT — never constructed, verdicts unchanged.

An undeclared completed episode has ``declare_ts_s=null`` and a finite
``soak_start_s``. The same soak checks remain gradeable from measured state.

Each check dict has the contract shape: {"pass": bool, "value": ..., "limit": ...}.
The latency check additionally carries per-phase detail and a "provisional"
flag when manifest thresholds (rather than a calibration band) are used.
Generic latency/error ceilings and goodput floors receive the single
repository-wide tolerance from ``health_bands``.

    Runs only when ``thresholds.lane_health`` is declared AND async_metrics rows
    were provided (see ``include_lane_health`` in ``evaluate_outcome``).

    ``thresholds.lane_health`` SHAPE (each lane declares AT LEAST ONE limit)::

        lane_health:
          <lane>:                          # e.g. "index", "search"

            min_jobs_processed_delta: <int>   # OPTIONAL: min worker_jobs_processed_total delta

    Two complementary signals, because they catch DIFFERENT lane faults:

    * ``consumergroup_lag_max`` — the position-based fetch-lag GAUGE max over the
      window <= limit. The right signal for a FETCH-side fault (consumer falling
      behind the broker). NOTE: it is NOT reliable for a HANDLER stall — aiokafka
      ``position()`` advances on fetch, not on handling, so a slow-handler lane reads
      lag≈0 while the processing backlog grows. Use it for fetch/throughput faults.

    * ``min_jobs_processed_delta`` — the forward-progress signal: the per-lane
      ``worker_jobs_processed_total`` counter's (max-min) DELTA over the window must
      be >= limit. This is the reliable discriminator for a HANDLER stall (the lane
      processes ~0 jobs while stalled, thousands while healthy). The counter is NOT
      pre-seeded, so an ABSENT series means the lane processed nothing -> delta 0 ->
      FAIL (a real zero-progress signal, not an ambiguous empty window). Summed across
      the counter's ``result`` label series = total throughput for the lane.

    Window is ``ts_s`` based; ``window_start_s`` already carries the latency_settle_s
    drop (so the post-fix recovery/backlog-drain transient is excluded).

    FAIL LOUDLY (mirroring the saturation empty-window behaviour) only for the LAG
    check when a declared lane has NO lag samples in the window — without samples the
    drained-state cannot be proven. (The jobs-delta check treats an absent counter as
    genuine zero progress, which is itself the fault signal, so it fails closed too.)
