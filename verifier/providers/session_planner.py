"""Seeded virtual-user sessions for the open-loop loadgen (SimulController-shaped).

This module is the behavioural core that lets the loadgen offer a realistic Slack
traffic MIX (browse-heavy: switch channel -> scroll its history -> occasionally
post -> reply in a thread it has seen) instead of one request shape. It is modelled
on mattermost-load-test-ng's ``SimulController`` user model (Apache-2.0): a per-user
state machine that picks its next action from a production-derived weighted table.

THE KEYSTONE (why this stays open-loop + byte-reproducible)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The loadgen's arrival timeline is a seeded Poisson process owned by ``schedule.py``
(``random.Random(profile.seed)``) and decides only *when* an arrival fires. Per-arrival
*behaviour* is, today, a pure function of the monotone integer ``seq`` (driver =
``drivers[seq % len]``, channel = ``chan-{seq % keyspace}``). We keep that property:

    session_id = seq % n_sessions      # round-robin user assignment
    step       = seq // n_sessions     # this user's step index (strictly increasing)

Round-robin assignment gives two things for free:
  * each session's steps arrive in *strictly increasing* order, so its finite-state
    machine advances exactly one transition per arrival, in order;
  * the global Poisson stream is *thinned* into N independent per-session streams each
    at rate ``lambda/N`` -- so SimulController's blocking "think time" between a user's
    actions becomes an EMERGENT arrival property (mean inter-action gap = ``N/lambda``).
    Set ``n_sessions ~= lambda_representative * target_idle_s``. No blocking sleep is ever
    introduced; the arrival timeline is byte-identical to today (N only divides ``seq``).

THE DETERMINISM CONTRACT (the single rule that makes replay byte-identical)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A session's state is a pure function of ``(behavior_seed, n_sessions, seq)`` ONLY --
never of response bodies, HTTP status, latency, or task-completion order. The
``cursor_by_channel`` scroll position is the session's OWN synthetic monotone counter
(advanced by a fixed page stride), not a server-returned ``seq``. Consequently
``plan_for(seq)`` replays identically across episodes and is unaffected by which
arrivals the OUTSTANDING_CAP dropped -- *provided the runner calls ``plan_for`` for
every ``seq`` in increasing order* (it does: the call sits in ``_fire`` BEFORE the drop
branch, so dropped arrivals advance the FSM too).

Seeding note: ``random.Random(str)`` seeds via SHA-512 of the string (CPython version-2
seeding), NOT the builtin ``hash()`` -- so it is immune to ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` and
reproducible across runs/machines, which is what lets calibration cluster tightly.

ACTION -> DRIVER mapping
------------------------
``ActionPlan.action`` is a SEMANTIC action name (e.g. ``"session_history"``). The runner
maps it to a registered Driver (the request KIND that appears in ``record["driver"]``).
The realizable subset is renormalized from SimulController's 49-action table. Actions
with no slack-spine endpoint (drafts, typing, scheduled posts, bookmarks, sidebar/profile
ops) are honestly dropped and their mass is renormalized away. See ``SIMUL_ACTION_WEIGHTS``.
