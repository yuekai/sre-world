# Contributing to SRE-World

This guide covers the full lifecycle of adding to SRE-World: standing up a new
substrate (a system-under-test), authoring a scenario (one fault), generating the
runnable task, and calibrating it to a scored, hosted-ready state.

Prerequisites: `uv` (every tool runs through `uv run`), `helm`, and Docker plus
`kind` for the e2e and calibration steps. Start by confirming your toolchain:

```bash
./validate.sh smoke        # lint + contracts + generate --check + consistency + render + identity + probe
```

A green run takes about a minute and needs no cluster; once it passes, you are
ready. If you only want the 30-second happy path, see
[`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md). This document is the reference for the whole
loop.

For normal task work, use the single change-aware entry point:

```bash
uv run python -m tools.task_dev <substrate>/<scenario>
```

It regenerates, semantically classifies authored YAML, runs scoped local
checks, and lists external evidence. Draft PRs run credential-free `task-ci`;
ready PRs trigger the trusted coordinator. Only its `task-qualification` check
for the exact final SHA is required on `main`; do not require its individual
engine jobs separately.

**Frappe is incomplete and cannot receive automatic merge qualification.** Its
frozen contracts, host verifier, calibrated hosted gate, and stable released
base are unfinished. Static/build checks remain useful, but calibration or
hosted requirements are blocking errors.

## 1. Concepts: three layers, one strict boundary

SRE-World is organized as N substrates, each generating its own family of
fault-injection tasks. There are three layers, with a hard boundary between
source and generated output:

```
substrates/<name>/     SOURCE — the clean system-under-test (deploys HEALTHY by default)
      │                  substrate.yaml manifest + chart + build.sh + checks/ + loadgen + service images
      ▼
scenarios/<name>/<id>/  SOURCE — one fault, hand-authored (4 files)
      │                  spec.yaml + instruction.md + solve.sh + ground-truth.yaml
      ▼
tasks/<name>/<id>/     COMMITTED — self-contained Harbor task stamped by tools/generate_tasks.py
```

You author files under `substrates/` and `scenarios/`, then regenerate and
commit the self-contained `tasks/` output and the normalized `tasks/INDEX.json`
registry.

Two shared, substrate-agnostic pieces live at the repo root and hardcode no
substrate identity:

- `verifier/` is the deterministic dual-gate oracle. Gate 1 checks
  client-measured outcome bands from the loadgen: latency, error, and goodput,
  plus the opt-in `db_state`, `latency_by_driver`, `lane_health`, and
  `seq_integrity` channels. Gate 2 checks attribution (the incident report must
  name the exact `(service, component)` set) and minimality (the live config
  diff against the healthy baseline must stay inside the ground-truth
  allowlist, which is where wrong-knob "fixes" fail). No LLM is involved. The
  verifier's exact source is stamped into each task's `tests/oracle/` and reads
  `environment/chart/ground-truth.yaml` at runtime.
- `loadgen-common/` is the substrate-agnostic loadgen core that each
  per-substrate loadgen builds on.

Design principle: the shared tools (`tools/*.py`, `validate.sh`,
`verifier/oracle/`) read every substrate-specific value from the manifest,
never from a hardcoded constant. There is no central registry. A substrate is
registered by dropping in a valid `substrate.yaml`; the loader
`tools/substrate.py` discovers it, validates it against
`tools/schemas/substrate.schema.json` (Draft-7, `additionalProperties:false`),
and fails loudly on any violation.

```bash
uv run python -m tools.substrate --list                      # discovered substrates
uv run python -m tools.substrate --print slack-spine chart.path   # read one manifest value
```

---

## 2. Add a substrate

Create `substrates/<name>/` with the files below. Paths are relative to that
directory and are declared in the manifest; `substrates/slack-spine/substrate.yaml`
is the reference instance, with field-by-field comments.

| File / dir | Role |
|---|---|
| `substrate.yaml` | The manifest (schema `tools/schemas/substrate.schema.json`). Supplies `build_inputs` (fingerprints and affected builds), optional `kind_surface_inputs`, `chart.path`, `images.*`, `harbor.*`, `grader.url`, `lint.*`, `generate.fault_validators`, and `checks.*`. Optional blocks: `verifier`, `contracts`, `generate.prune`, `generate.config_hooks`, `generate.grader_overlay_extra`. |
| `<chart.path>/` | A Helm chart that deploys the healthy system by default. The healthy baseline is what minimality diffs against. |
| `<build_script>` (`build.sh`) | Builds every `images.custom` entry as `<basename>:dev` for local side-load. |
| `checks/fault_validators.py` | Per-tier overlay validators (`validate_config_tier` + `validate_layer` + `validate_runtime_tier`): substrate-owned code that knows this chart's values schema (knob uniformity per docs/DECISIONS.md D7, layer confinement, runtime confinement). Wired via `generate.fault_validators`. |
| `checks/leak_probe.py` | The leak/exploit invariant battery (`checks.leak_probe`). |
| `checks/render_checks.sh` | Render assertions that the fault mechanisms inject as designed (`checks.render`). |
| loadgen + service `*.Dockerfile` | The per-substrate loadgen (built on `loadgen-common/`) and the source and Dockerfiles for each custom image. |
| `verifier/` (optional) | A host-side debugging verifier plus `verifier.host_import_path`. May be deferred on a young substrate; committed tasks still grade with their stamped oracle, and the gate announces the host-verifier deferral loudly. |
| `contracts/` (optional) | Machine-readable freeze (registry/topology/metrics). May be deferred; `checks.harbor_gate_scenario` may also be deferred until the first scenario calibrates. |

Build and, when ready, publish the images:

```bash
./substrates/<name>/build.sh                                  # build <basename>:dev locally
uv run python -m tools.push_images --substrate <name>         # amd64 build + tag :<release> + push + write images.lock.json
uv run python -m tools.push_images --substrate <name> --verify-only   # CI: registry digests still match the lock
```

The reference substrate `slack-spine` builds 7 custom images: `slack-app`,
`slack-go`, `slack-py`, `slack-main`, `slack-obs-mcp`, `slack-loadgen`,
`slack-pgbouncer`.

A deferred `verifier`, `contracts`, or `harbor_gate_scenario` is announced
loudly by the validation gates, never silently skipped. See
`substrates/frappe/substrate.yaml` for a young substrate that defers all three.

Full contract: [`docs/SUBSTRATE-INTERFACE.md`](docs/SUBSTRATE-INTERFACE.md).

## 3. Author a scenario

> first. It documents the substrate contracts that are enforced in code but not
> here — the runtime-tier activation contract, the attribution namespaces, the
> per-substrate task-name length cap, and the recognized scenario paths.

### Fault-layer-first policy

Treat the released shared base images as frozen during ordinary task
authoring. Most new image-backed tasks should be implemented as thin,
task-specific fault layers, not by adding task behavior or dormant fault
variants to a substrate base image. A fault layer starts from the pinned base
digest, contains only that task's image delta, is content-addressed, and is
published independently.

Use the lightest correct mechanism:

- A configuration fault remains a Helm values overlay.
- A runtime fault remains a narrowly scoped post-install mutation.
- A code or image-byte fault normally becomes a task-specific fault layer.
- A shared-base edit is exceptional and requires a maintainer substrate
  release. It is appropriate only for framework, substrate-wide, dependency,
  security, or shared runtime maintenance.

If a proposed task appears to require changing the shared base, first try to
express its task-specific bytes as a fault layer. Do not broaden the base merely
to make one scenario easier to build.

One fault is one directory, `scenarios/<name>/<id>/`, with exactly four
hand-authored files:

### Name tasks for humans

Every spec declares a lowercase semantic `slug` that says what fails, such as
`maintenance-collision`, `split-sequencer`, or `seq-lock-leak`. This is the name
authors type into `task_dev`, `/grade`, and `/calibrate`, qualified by the
substrate when necessary.

Existing coded directory ids remain stable storage and provenance keys; do not
rename them merely for readability. New tasks should use the semantic slug for
both `id` and `slug` instead of inventing a catalog number, difficulty code,
tier code, initials, or ordering prefix. The resolver rejects malformed or
duplicate slugs loudly. Low-level tools that consume a literal `tasks/` path
may still expose the stable storage id; it is not a name authors need to
memorize.

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `spec.yaml` | Identity (`id`, human-facing `slug`, `task.name`, `task.scenario`, which must carry the substrate's `task_name_prefix`/`scenario_prefix`), `task.metadata` (`profile`, `causal_distance`, `temporal_emergence`, `fault_presentation`, optional `agent_timeout_sec`/`verifier_timeout_sec`/sizing/`eval_ready`), the `substrate:` name, and the fault itself under `fault.tier`: one of `config` (Tier-1, a Helm values overlay), `image` (Tier-2, a per-task fault layer: `fault.layer` plus `scenarios/<id>/layer/`), or `runtime` (Tier-3, a post-install hook or `kubectl` mutation). |
| `instruction.md` | The agent-facing prompt. Describe symptoms, never mechanisms; it must not leak the fix. |
| `solve.sh` | The golden OracleAgent trajectory (the repair, scripted). |
| `ground-truth.yaml` | The oracle answer key: `fault.{injected,golden_fix}`, `component_registry`, `ground_truth.{service,component,mechanism}`, `mechanism_keywords`, `minimality.allowed_keys_by_component`, and `thresholds`. Start with `thresholds.provisional: true`; you flip it in calibration (§5). |

All three fault tiers are supported by the generator and verifier. The retained
generated catalog currently contains Tier-1 config and Tier-2 image scenarios;
there is no retained Tier-3 runtime scenario. Tier-2 shipped as scenario
`seq-lock-leak` and was generalized by the universal
per-task-image model (see docs/DECISIONS.md D16). A Tier-2 fault is a per-task
fault layer: a thin image `FROM base@digest` plus the delta authored at
`scenarios/<id>/layer/<key>/`, declared under `fault.layer`, published by the
`release-candidate` workflow in `layers` mode, and digest-pinned in the lock's
tasks section. The shared base carries no dormant fault catalog, and the repair
stays operational only: an SQL/DB action, not a source edit or a re-pin.

Copy the nearest retained sibling: `split-sequencer` or `maintenance-collision`
(Tier-1 config with state grading), or `seq-lock-leak` (Tier-2 image).
Runtime-tier authoring remains supported,
but currently has no retained example scenario.

The anti-leak rule (docs/DECISIONS.md D7) bites here: the faulted knob must
exist uniformly across roles so it is not a greppable outlier. The generator
asserts this against the healthy chart values, and the `lint` and `probe` gates
re-check it.

Only fault corridors the loadgen actually exercises are gradeable (the send
path, the async index lane, and the data tier). Check
`substrates/slack-spine/contracts/` before designing a fault, or you will only
find out at calibration that nothing measures it.

### Choose the agent surface explicitly

`agent_surface` defaults to `confined`. Use `shell-visible` only when a real
in-pod shell adds diagnostic value without exposing an environment-armed fault.
Use `build-capable` only for an unconditional image-tier source fault whose
complete repair allowlist is strictly below `services/app/src/`. Build-capable
selects exactly one target role and persists source only; dependencies, the
compiler workspace, and compiled output remain trusted and ephemeral.

See [`docs/AGENT-SURFACES.md`](docs/AGENT-SURFACES.md) for the required spec
fields, RBAC and hardening invariants, the source-snapshot grading contract,
and the four-level validation ladder. Do not clear a surface task's provisional
flag from render/unit tests or the lean kind contract alone: calibration
requires Blacksmith/kind golden `3/3 PASS` and nop `3/3 FAIL`, and final merge
qualification requires one hosted Oddish experiment containing oracle 1/1,
nop 1/1, and five GLM 5p2 trials whose mean reward is `0.00–0.20` inclusive.

---

## 4. Generate the task

Generation is flagless and deterministic. Every input (specs, manifest, images
lock, chart) is committed, and the emitted `tasks/<name>/<id>/` is the
hosted-executable form, with Daytona sizing and the pinned registry release
baked in:

```bash
uv run python -m tools.generate_tasks <name>/<id>     # regenerate one task
uv run python -m tools.generate_tasks --all           # regenerate all + refresh tasks/INDEX.json
uv run python -m tools.generate_tasks --all --check    # prove deterministic output + INDEX consistency
```

Generation refuses to run unless `substrates/<name>/images.lock.json` exists,
its `release` matches the manifest, and it records a digest for every custom
image. In practice this means you publish the images first (§2). It also
refuses an implicit `thresholds.provisional`: the flag must be an explicit
`true` or `false`.

Each task's row in `tasks/INDEX.json` carries the readiness signal:

```
hosted_ready = (thresholds.provisional == false)
             AND (metadata.eval_ready != false)
             AND (calibration.base_fingerprint == current base fingerprint)
             AND (calibration.layer_fingerprint == current fault fingerprint)
             AND (health_version is current, when health_ref is used)
```

The fingerprint clause is load-bearing. Bands are measurements of a specific
system, so when the substrate source changes, its fingerprint moves and every
stale calibration downgrades loudly to not-hosted-ready instead of silently
rotting.

---

## 5. Calibrate to FP=FN=0

This is the step that earns a scored task. Build the `:dev` images, then run
the M8 harness:

```bash
./substrates/<name>/build.sh
uv run python -m tools.calibrate <name>/<id> --golden 3 --nop 3 --write
```

Required result: golden 3/3 reward 1.0 and nop 3/3 reward 0.0, i.e. false
positives = false negatives = 0. On FP=FN=0, `--write` patches the spec's
`ground-truth.yaml` bands and provenance, flips `thresholds.provisional:
false`, stamps `calibration.base_fingerprint` and
`calibration.layer_fingerprint`, and regenerates the task, closing the
calibrate → spec → task loop. Omit `--write` to inspect first.

Band tuning is capture-once, tune-offline: `--no-run` re-aggregates the
already-captured trials against the (edited) spec ground-truth without touching
a cluster.

```bash
uv run python -m tools.calibrate <name>/<id> --no-run       # re-grade captured rundirs offline after editing bands
```

In CI, comment `/calibrate <name>/<id>` on the PR. A Blacksmith fan-out runs
the golden/nop trials and, with write-back, commits the bands onto the PR
branch. `/calibrate` alone auto-detects the one changed scenario.

A source edit that moves `sut_fingerprint` automatically invalidates the bands
and visibly downgrades `hosted_ready`. Recalibration is required; a bare
re-stamp is not enough. (Proven in practice: an earlier connection-cap task's
2026-06-20 bands failed
golden on 2026-07-03 after app changes.)

**Gotcha:** `:dev` tags are Docker-daemon-global. Always rebuild from your own
worktree right before calibrating, or a sibling worktree's stale image silently
disarms your fault.

---

## 6. Validate & run

Structural gates (cluster-free, about a minute):

```bash
./validate.sh smoke     # lint + contracts + generate --check + consistency + render + identity + probe
```

End-to-end oracle gate (needs the `harbor` CLI, Docker, and `kind`):

```bash
./validate.sh harbor    # per substrate: oracle → PASS, nop → FAIL via harbor run -e helm
./validate.sh all       # smoke + harbor
```

The access-surface-specific real-cluster contract is narrower and faster than a
full Harbor task:

```bash
./substrates/slack-spine/build.sh
./substrates/slack-spine/checks/kind_agent_surfaces.sh
```

It proves exact exec authorization, loadgen/list denial, stable StatefulSet
names, PVC persistence, trusted rebuild success, and visible compile failure.
It intentionally deploys only the message path, PostgreSQL, main, and loadgen;
follow it with the full local and hosted runs documented in
[`docs/AGENT-SURFACES.md`](docs/AGENT-SURFACES.md).

To run a real agent (or the oracle/nop) locally on `kind`, use
`tools/local_run.py`, which restores the side-loaded `:dev` dev loop over the
committed hosted-canonical task:

```bash
uv run python -m tools.local_run --task tasks/<name>/<id> --agent oracle --job-name dev --out jobs
```

`--agent` takes `oracle | nop | claude-code | …`, and `--dry-run` prints the
exact `harbor run -e helm` argv. Read the per-gate breakdown in
`jobs/<run>/verifier/verdict.json` before believing any pass/fail.

Hosted (Oddish / k3s-in-Daytona):

```bash
ODDISH_API_KEY=ok_... oddish run \
  -p tasks/<name>/<id> -e daytona -a oracle --n-trials 3
```

Oddish owns the provider-side scheduling, so the caller supplies an Oddish API
key rather than a Daytona provider key. The manual `run-trial` Actions workflow
performs this submission and pulls the remote status and artifacts back into
the workflow run.

For an advisory LLM task-quality and anti-cheat review, comment
`/grade <name>/<id>` on the PR (maintainers only; it is a paid model call). It
scores against `ci_checks/rubric-sre-world.toml` and posts the verdict as a new
comment (marked `<!-- sre-world-task-grade -->`) under your `/grade`.

---

## 7. Get a task PR merged

A contributor owns the authored scenario and the deterministic generated
output. A maintainer owns credentials, immutable publication, and the final
hosted release gate. For a normal config/runtime task, the complete handoff is:

1. Edit the authored scenario and run
   `uv run python -m tools.task_dev <name>/<id>`.
2. Open a **draft** PR. `task-ci` runs static/security/provenance checks and
   only affected credential-free builds or declared real-kind surface proof.
3. Mark it ready. The full Python suite runs, then the default-branch
   coordinator recomputes impact from the base and exact head SHA. It permits
   secrets only for a same-repository PR from a write-authorized author.
4. The coordinator invokes only required engines: advisory LLM review,
   matching-capture offline regrade, affected task-layer publication, policy-v2
   calibration, and one hosted Oddish experiment containing one oracle, one
   nop, and five `claude-code` / `fireworks/glm-5p2` trials. The GLM cohort
   must have an inclusive mean reward of `0.00–0.20`.
5. Layer/calibration write-back creates a bot commit without `[skip ci]`. The
   old run becomes neutral and the new SHA is qualified; matching fingerprints
   prevent another write loop.
6. Merge only when the exact final SHA has a green `task-qualification`.
   Missing keys, stale captures, moved heads, Frappe gaps, and base-release
   requirements fail visibly.

Task layers are content-addressed and only affected layers publish. If shared
base bytes changed, ordinary qualification stops: a maintainer must use
`release-candidate` with `mode=base`, then `promote-release` after hosted gates
pass (§8).

A task with `publication_pending`, `provisional: true`, a stale fingerprint, a
missing source snapshot, a failed baseline, an incomplete GLM cohort, or a
GLM mean reward outside `0.00–0.20`, or a false-green Harbor result is not
merge-ready. Do not waive those failures.

Fork PRs can run `smoke`, but GitHub cannot write calibrated bands back to the
fork. A maintainer must run calibration on a same-repository branch or apply
the resulting authored-file patch to the fork PR explicitly.

---

## 8. Images & releases

Custom images live at `ghcr.io/yuekai/sre-world/<basename>:<release>` (re-hosted by digest from the original `ghcr.io/abundant-ai/sre-world`).
The current release tag for each substrate lives in its manifest
(`substrates/<name>/substrate.yaml`, `images.release`) — that is the source of truth,
not this page. At time of writing: `slack-spine` → `:v14`, `frappe` → `:v16`.

Releases are immutable and PR-centered. A substrate PR chooses its intended
final tag in `images.release` (for example `v5`), then a maintainer dispatches:

```bash
gh workflow run release-candidate.yaml --ref <pr-branch> \
  -f pr_number=<pr> -f substrates=<name> -f mode=base
```

This builds and publishes a unique `rc-pr<pr>-<sha>` candidate and commits its
lock, normalized index, and restamped committed tasks back to that PR. It never
touches the final tag.
Calibrate and run hosted oracle/nop trials against that candidate. When all
required scenarios have passed, promote exactly those bytes:

```bash
gh workflow run promote-release.yaml --ref <pr-branch> \
  -f pr_number=<pr> -f substrate=<name> -f release=v5 \
  -f scenarios=<scenario-a>,<scenario-b>
```

Promotion fails if a final tag already names different bytes. It copies the
candidate manifests, updates `images.lock.json`, regenerates every task, reruns
smoke/provenance, and commits the final state back to the same PR branch. There
is no second release PR and no post-trial rebuild. A genuinely unscoreable
young substrate may pass `defer_hosted=true` with no scenarios; that is an
explicit warning-only deferral, never an implied hosted approval.

Superseded and untagged versions are reaped by `tools/gc_images.py` (dry-run by
default; `--execute` needs `delete:packages`).

The substrate manifest is the source of truth for registry and release names;
the committed lock is the source of truth for immutable digests. Do not copy
registry coordinates from old job artifacts or superseded task trees.

## Tool reference

Every tool runs through `uv run python -m tools.<name>`.

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `substrate` | Per-substrate manifest loader; `--list` and `--print` read `substrate.yaml` values |
| `generate_tasks` | Spec → self-contained Harbor task generator; also writes `tasks/INDEX.json` |
| `local_run` | Run one committed task on a local kind cluster with `:dev` image overrides |
| `calibrate` | M8 golden/nop calibration harness; `--no-run` re-grades captured rundirs offline |
| `regrade` | Offline re-grade of a captured rundir (band tuning, no cluster) |
| `lint_scenario` | Answer-key lint over each substrate's agent-visible surface |
| `check_task_identity` | Every task chart copy byte-identical to its substrate chart |
| `check_task_consistency` | Cross-file coherence of the answer key (Lane-A QA hard gate) |
| `validate_substrate_contracts` | Contract-freeze validator plus tamper tests |
| `push_images` | Immutable image publication; writes `images.lock.json` |
| `gc_images` | Garbage-collect superseded GHCR image releases |

`validate.sh` wires the check tools into the `smoke` gate, so you rarely run
them by hand.
