"""Deployment overlay for YAML-defined load profiles (the ``PROFILE_FILE`` hook).

Profiles are data everywhere: the builtin ``PROFILES`` are themselves loaded
from ``loadgen/profiles.yaml`` by ``loadgen.schedule`` (which also owns the
parser, ``load_profiles`` — re-exported here for compatibility). This module
adds only the DEPLOYMENT seam: a ConfigMap-mounted YAML file named by the
``PROFILE_FILE`` env var is merged OVER the builtin dict at sidecar startup,
so custom load patterns reach any environment without an image rebuild
(modeled on the Mattermost load-test config approach). ``PROFILE`` then
selects by name exactly as before — the runner/oracle contracts are untouched
because the in-memory shape stays the ``Profile`` dataclass.

Schema (shared with the builtin file — see ``loadgen/profiles.yaml`` for a
fully-worked, commented example; all durations seconds, rates requests/sec)::

    profiles:
      my_eval:
        base: eval25            # optional: start from a known profile and override
        loop: true              # cycles repeat until declare_deadline_s
        declare_deadline_s: 3600  # legacy name for pre-soak schedule end
        undeclared_evidence_min_s: null  # retired; D28 task resolution requires null
        rate_jitter: 0.2        # per-phase seeded rate noise (no two cycles alike)
        baseline_rps: 2         # floor: there is always baseline activity
        cycles:                 # list OR mapping form per cycle
          - [20, 50, 40, 10]    # [peak_s, peak_rps, trough_s, trough_rps]
          - {peak_s: 20, peak_rps: 50, trough_s: 40, trough_rps: 10}
        repeat_cycles: 25       # sugar: replicate the cycles list N times
        soak_cycles: 4
        drivers: [write_readback]
        events:
          - {kind: admin_event, fire_at_s: 40, duration_s: 0,
             event_name: read_consistency_strict, target_service: svc-channel}
        n_sessions: 128         # SimulController-shaped virtual-session layer
        action_weights: {session_post_message: 2.0}

FAIL LOUDLY: a set-but-missing/unreadable/invalid file aborts sidecar startup —
if an operator mounted a load pattern, running a different one is never
acceptable. Shadowing a builtin profile name is allowed but logs a loud
warning (the builtin name's calibrated bands do not apply to a reshaped load).
