"""Open-loop async load generator — the shared engine every substrate reuses.

Substrate-neutral: request KINDS (drivers) live with each substrate
(``loadgen_slack/drivers.py``, ``loadgen_frappe/drivers.py``) and are
registered into the ``DRIVERS`` registry at sidecar startup; load SHAPES are
data (``loadgen/profiles.yaml`` + per-substrate/per-deployment overlays).

Design goals (per CONTRACTS.md / SPIKE.md):

- **Open-loop**: arrivals are scheduled on the asyncio clock relative to a fixed
  ``t0``. We NEVER await a response before firing the next request
  (fire-and-forget tasks). If we fall behind the schedule we fire *immediately*
  and never skip an arrival — open-loop offered load must be preserved so a
  saturated trough can drain and the symptom can actually manifest.
- **Bounded backlog**: at most ``OUTSTANDING_CAP`` (500) requests may be
  in-flight at once. If a new arrival would exceed the cap it is recorded as a
  ``dropped`` arrival and logged loudly — we do NOT block (blocking would turn
  this into a closed-loop generator and mask the fault).
- **Single session**: one ``aiohttp.ClientSession`` with a 10s total timeout.
- **Durable record**: every arrival appends one JSONL line to ``out_path``; a
  final ``{"summary": true, ...}`` line carries the totals.
- **In-memory tail**: the last ``RECENT_MAXLEN`` records are kept in
  ``LoadGen.recent`` (a ``collections.deque``) so the agent actor's
  ``read_metrics`` tool can roll them up without re-reading the JSONL.

ONE EPISODE CLOCK
-----------------
``t0`` is pinned by the authenticated episode-start transition at the end of
Harbor's first successful environment-healthcheck command. Cluster creation,
Helm install, and every readiness predicate happen before the clock exists.
Harbor agent setup happens after it and therefore consumes the window. The
runner waits for :meth:`LoadGen.signal_episode_start` and fails loudly after
``EPISODE_START_TIMEOUT_S`` rather than idling forever if the healthcheck never
completes the transition.

The episode after t0 is::

    [0, warmup_s)          warmup, excluded from measurement
    [0, agent_window_s]    Harbor setup plus agent work; the agent may finish early
    freeze                 at min(done_signal, agent_window_s): the agent is
                           terminated through the substrate freezer's graceful
                           ladder, so nothing it does can touch the graded window
    [soak_start, +soak_s]  the soak — the ONLY graded window; it always runs and
                           is always exactly ``soak_duration_s()`` long
    end

``soak_start`` is the first cycle boundary at or after the freeze completes, so
the graded window is always cycle-aligned. ``agent_window_s`` is one cycle short
of the nominal pre-soak schedule end (see :func:`agent_window_s`). That cycle is
the minimum reserve; if the freezer, config/source capture, or build attestation
takes longer, the runner keeps repeating the pre-soak cycle shapes under the
same seeded stream until the resolved boundary. It then switches serially to
the independently seeded soak stream, so there is neither an idle/cold gap nor
an overlap between ungraded and graded traffic.

There is no report-intake cutoff. Declaring is purely an early-finish signal; a
report is recorded whenever it arrives and is never rejected for lateness.

Control API (stable names — the harness imports
``from loadgen.runner import LoadGen``):

- ``LoadGen(profile, out_path, agent_boundary_hook=...)``: construct. The hook is
  awaited at the freeze instant and must not return until the agent is provably
  dead; the runner starts the soak only after it completes.
- ``lg.signal_episode_start()``: pin ``t0`` (first call wins).
- ``await lg.run()``: the entry point the episode runner awaits. Waits for the
  episode-start signal, runs warmup + the pre-soak window, freezes, then runs
  ``soak_cycles`` full cycles re-based to the soak-start instant and stops.
- ``lg.declare()``: record that a resolution was declared "now" and request the
  freeze. If the agent declares before the configured warmup has elapsed, the
  runner keeps issuing warmup traffic and starts the graded soak at the warmup
  boundary. This makes an OracleAgent that repairs quickly see the same
  warmed-load soak a real diagnostic agent would see, instead of grading against
  a cold pool. Declaring early shortens the agent window; it NEVER shortens the
  soak.
- ``lg.stop()``: hard stop — cease firing and tear down ASAP.
- ``lg.finished``: ``asyncio.Event`` set once the generator has fully stopped,
  drained outstanding requests, and written the summary line.
- ``lg.recent``: ``deque`` of the most recent record dicts.
- ``lg.declare_ts_s`` / ``lg.freeze_ts_s`` / ``lg.soak_start_s``: declaration /
  freeze / soak-start times (seconds from ``t0``). ``declare_ts_s`` is ``None``
  when no report was filed; the other two are always set on a complete episode.
  Mirrors meta.json fields.

Module-level ``rollup(records) -> dict`` produces the compact per-phase summary
used by the agent actor's ``read_metrics`` rollup.

Deferred design item (P2 ``write_readback_async``, now in loadgen_slack/drivers.py):
the async readback re-poll uses a small WALL-CLOCK inter-attempt cadence
(``WRITE_ASYNC_READBACK_CADENCE_S``) so a healthy async write reads back within
``WRITE_ASYNC_READBACK_ATTEMPTS``. This is acceptable for P2 healthy-chain
validation, but a GRADED async-lane-lag fault later MUST move the readback to an
offered-load / deferred-across-arrivals basis (no per-arrival wall-clock sleep) for
determinism. The sync ``WriteReadbackDriver`` stays attempt-count-only (no clock).

# opts in via ``Profile.drivers`` (the ``write`` profile). So absent an opt-in,

# byte-identical (zero extra requests per arrival). Boot / login drivers remain
