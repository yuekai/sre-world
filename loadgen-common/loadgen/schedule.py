"""Load profiles and seeded Poisson arrival generation for the open-loop loadgen.

This module is the single source of truth for *when* requests are offered to the
SUT. Arrivals are generated as a Poisson process (exponential inter-arrival
times) at each phase's instantaneous rate, driven by a single seeded
``random.Random(profile.seed)`` so the entire offered-load timeline is
reproducible across episodes.

Public surface (kept stable — imported by the harness as
``from loadgen.schedule import PROFILES``):

- ``Profile`` dataclass.
- ``PROFILES: dict[str, Profile]`` with keys ``"dev"``, ``"spec"``, ``"demo"``,
  ``"eval25"`` (long-running real-model window), and the WRITE profiles ``"write"``
  (dev-scale, fires the WriteReadbackDriver — 03-W1), ``"write25"`` (eval-scale write,
  reserved), and ``"write_async"`` (dev-scale, fires the WriteReadbackAsyncDriver that
  reads back through the real kafka->worker->search chain — P2).
- ``iter_arrivals(profile) -> Iterator[tuple[float, str]]`` yielding
  ``(arrival_time_s_from_start, phase_label)`` for warmup + all named cycles,
  then continuing into the soak window with ``soak.peak`` / ``soak.trough``
  labels. The generator does NOT decide when soak starts in wall-clock terms;
  it simply keeps producing arrivals — the *runner* decides how long to consume
  (terminal freeze → ``soak_cycles`` full cycles → stop). Soak arrivals reuse the
  exact same phase shapes as the configured cycles.
- ``iter_looped_arrivals(profile)`` / ``iter_soak_arrivals(profile)``: the
  LOOP-mode split of the same contract (``Profile.loop=True``). The pre-soak
  stream repeats the configured cycle shapes (labels keep counting: ``c3``,
  ``c4``, …) until ``declare_deadline_s``, so the load window is decoupled
  from the length of the ``cycles`` list; the soak stream comes from an
  INDEPENDENT seeded RNG so the graded window is byte-identical no matter
  when the terminal boundary lands mid-loop. Consumed lazily by the runner (never
  materialized).

Phase labels (per CONTRACTS.md):
  ``warmup`` | ``c<i>.peak`` | ``c<i>.trough`` (i from 1) | ``soak.peak`` | ``soak.trough``

class LoadEvent:
    """A one-shot mid-episode load-shape EVENT fired at a fixed schedule time (M5).

    The fire-at-T primitive: at ``fire_at_s`` (seconds from t0, on the SAME seeded
    schedule clock as arrivals) the event takes effect for ``duration_s`` seconds, then
    reverts. The only kind today is ``"keyspace_surge"``: shrink the write-channel
    keyspace to ``keyspace`` for the window, concentrating all writes onto fewer
    channels (max per-channel concurrency) to amplify a same-channel race — e.g. the
    06-F3 non-atomic sequencer lost-update — at a KNOWN instant. This folds a collision
    injector and a vlt spike into one. The runner resolves the effective keyspace per
    arrival from a profile's events (``runner._effective_keyspace``); default-empty on
    every profile so existing scenarios are byte-identical.

    The second kind is ``"admin_event"`` (M7 mid-soak Signal): at ``fire_at_s`` the
    loadgen POSTs to the SUT's ``/admin/event`` to ACTIVATE the named ``event_name`` (an
    ENVIRONMENT config-push, NOT an operator action), flipping a service into a degraded
    runtime path MID-EPISODE so the symptom EMERGES at T (temporal emergence). By default a
    one-shot activation that STAYS active until the agent reverts it (``duration_s`` unused).

    AUTO-REVERT (07-M2 metastable trigger): when ``auto_revert`` is set on an ``admin_event``
    (requires ``duration_s > 0``), the activation is followed ``duration_s`` later by a
    DEACTIVATION — a brief, self-clearing blip. This is the metastable ignition primitive:
    the trigger vanishes on its own, yet the retry storm it tipped over SUSTAINS itself after
    the blip clears, so "revert the trigger" is a no-op (already reverted) and the agent must
    BREAK the loop instead. Existing admin_event profiles leave ``auto_revert=False`` so the
    revert branch is dead code for them (byte-identical). Fired by
    ``runner.LoadGen._fire_admin_event``.

class Profile:
    """An open-loop load profile.

    Attributes:
        name: Profile identifier (``"dev"`` / ``"spec"``).
        seed: RNG seed for the Poisson arrival process (reproducibility).
        warmup_s: Duration of the initial warmup phase, seconds.
        warmup_rps: Mean arrival rate during warmup, requests/sec.
        cycles: List of ``(peak_s, peak_rps, trough_s, trough_rps)`` tuples,
            one per load cycle. Each cycle is a peak phase immediately followed
            by a trough phase.
        soak_cycles: Number of additional full cycles to run after the terminal
            freeze, whether report-driven or window-driven. Soak cycles reuse the *shape* of the
            configured cycles (cycle index ``i`` of the soak reuses
            ``cycles[i % len(cycles)]``), but are labelled ``soak.peak`` /
            ``soak.trough`` so the oracle can isolate the post-fix window.
        declare_deadline_s: Legacy schema name for the pre-soak schedule end,
            measured from t0. D28 derives it from the task's single
            ``agent_window_s`` episode budget; it does not limit report intake.
        undeclared_evidence_min_s: Retired compatibility field. D28 task
            resolution forces it to ``None``; it remains parseable for old
            profile data but has no runner control path.
        drivers: Optional list of driver-name strings selecting the request KIND
            fired per arrival (resolved against ``runner.DRIVERS``). ``None``
            (the default) means "use ``runner.DEFAULT_DRIVERS``" — i.e. the
