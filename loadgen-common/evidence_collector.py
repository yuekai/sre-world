"""Evidence collection and rundir-assembly helpers.

Three consumers use this source and MUST stay evidence-identical:

  * the host-side debugging verifier (``verifier/slack_spine_verifier.py``),
    which reaches the cluster via kubectl/helm and delegates every pure
    decision here, and
  * the protected collector inside the loadgen sidecar
    (``substrate/loadgen_sidecar.py``), which assembles the same rundir from
    the files it already owns under ``/grader`` plus in-cluster HTTP probes,
    then serves the finalized evidence bundle, and
  * each committed task's vendored ``tests/verifier/`` copy, used only after
    the bundle has reached Harbor's root verifier.

Everything in this module is a pure function of its inputs (no kubectl, no
helm, no cluster I/O) — that single-source-of-truth property is what keeps the
two paths from drifting. The only filesystem helper (``complete_soak_end_tree``)
copies already-written rundir files.

This module never imports the evaluator and never makes pass/fail or reward
decisions. Error-message text for the moved functions is kept verbatim from
the original verifier implementations because unit tests assert on it.
