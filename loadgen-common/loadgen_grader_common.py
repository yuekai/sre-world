"""Shared HTTP wiring for protected evidence collection.

Substrate-agnostic pieces of the loadgen sidecar: path constants, envelope
normalisation, the fixed-allowlist tar bundle, and the aiohttp routes for
``POST /grader/episode-start`` + ``POST /report`` + ``POST /declare_repair_complete`` + ``GET /healthz`` +
``GET /grader/{episode_done,bundle}``.
Every substrate's sidecar (``substrates/slack-spine/loadgen_sidecar.py``,
``substrates/frappe/loadgen_sidecar.py``) imports from here. Home:
``loadgen-common/`` — alongside the shared scheduling core (``loadgen/``);
each substrate's build script stages the collector into its image build context.

What stays substrate-specific in each sidecar:
  * ``handle_declare`` — the config-snapshot fan-out at declare time
    (Slack: ``svc-<role>:8000/admin/config``; Frappe: role-specific).
  * ``parse_metrics`` — substrate-specific Prometheus gauge names.
  * DB-state probes — Postgres vs MariaDB SQL.

Why factor at *this* seam: the HTTP contract (`/report`, `/declare_repair_complete`,
`/healthz`, `/grader/*`)
is what ``tests/test.sh`` grades against. Keeping it in one place guarantees both
sidecars serve byte-identical routes. The declare-time config snapshot is
substrate-specific because the SUT's admin API endpoints differ.

    Separated from the TCP bind (each sidecar owns its own ``start_http_server``)
    so tests can drive the routing with an aiohttp TestClient without opening a
    real :9100 listener.

    ``handle_declare`` is passed by the caller so per-substrate declare logic
    (config-snapshot fan-out, etc.) can differ while the HTTP wiring — routes,
    status codes, response bodies — stays byte-identical across substrates.

    Filing a report and ending the episode are two different actions on two
    different routes. They used to be one: POSTing an incident report froze the
    agent and opened the graded soak, which made a piece of prose the only way to
    stop the clock and made "did you write it up" inseparable from "did you fix
    it". Splitting them means an agent can file its narrative and keep working,
    or end the episode without one, and reward reads the same either way.

    Routes and their gates:
      * ``POST /grader/episode-start`` — the final transition in Harbor's
                                  environment-healthcheck command. It pins t0
                                  after readiness and before setup. It uses the
                                  verifier-only capability; an agent must not
                                  choose its own origin.
      * ``POST /report``        — advisory. Records the incident report and
                                  returns. It never freezes the agent, never opens
                                  the soak, and never reaches reward. First report
                                  wins; a later one is 409 and changes nothing.
      * ``POST /declare_repair_complete`` — THE explicit ending. 503 until the
                                  episode's LoadGen exists (``state["lg"]`` is
                                  published by run_episode), then the
                                  caller-supplied first-declare-wins handler.
                                  There is no deadline it can miss; an episode
                                  that never calls it is frozen at its deadline
                                  and graded from its final state.
      * ``GET /healthz``        — always 200 (the chart's liveness surface).
      * ``GET /grader/*`` — requires the verifier-only capability. An absent or
                              invalid capability always returns 403, before any
                              episode state is disclosed.
      * ``GET /grader/episode_done`` — 503 until episode_done.json exists, then
                                  its payload (including any ``error`` field, so
                                  a grading failure surfaces FAST, not by timeout).
      * ``GET /grader/bundle``  — same gate; the fixed-allowlist rundir tar.

    The gate order makes the agent-phase view airtight: protected evidence reads
    are 503 until the soak is complete and all rundir files are finalized
    (strict write order in run_episode). The authenticated lifecycle POST carries
    no evidence, and NO answer key is ever served (the key lives only in this
    pod's /grader-key mount; endpoints serve /grader outputs only).
