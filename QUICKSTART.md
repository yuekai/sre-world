# SRE-World Quickstart

This guide gets you from a fresh checkout to a local or remote run of an
existing SRE-World task. Use it to verify your setup before authoring a new
scenario.

The reference run uses the built-in `oracle` agent, so you do not need model API
keys.

## The task-development path

For an ordinary scenario edit, start with:

```bash
uv run python -m tools.task_dev <substrate>/<scenario>
```

It regenerates the task, semantically compares `HEAD` with the working tree,
runs applicable scoped smoke checks, and reports external work. Unknown paths
and unrecognized YAML fields block loudly.

The PR lifecycle is draft `task-ci` → ready trusted qualification → merge. A
layer or calibration bot commit retriggers the lifecycle, and the exact final
SHA must receive a green `task-qualification` check. The `main` ruleset
requires that single aggregate check; individual qualification engine jobs are
implementation details and must not be added as separate merge requirements.

Shared substrate/base-image changes stop with a maintainer release requirement.
Candidate bytes are built once, hosted-tested, then promoted to `vN` without
rebuilding.

When authoring a new task, treat those shared base images as frozen. Most new
image-backed tasks should add a thin, content-addressed task fault layer on top
of the pinned base instead of modifying or rebuilding the base. Keep config
faults as Helm overlays and runtime faults as scoped mutations; reserve base
changes for substrate-wide framework, dependency, or security maintenance.

> **Frappe is not automatically merge-qualifiable.** It still lacks frozen
> contracts, a host verifier, a calibrated hosted gate, and a stable released
> base. Static/build checks can run, but unavailable proof blocks loudly.

## Prerequisites

For local Docker/kind runs, install:

- `uv`
- Docker, with the daemon running
- `kind`
- `helm`

The repository pins the Harbor CLI through `uv`; you do not need a separate
global Harbor install.

For remote Daytona runs, install `uv` and make sure `DAYTONA_API_KEY` is set.
You can skip Docker, `kind`, and Helm if you only use the remote path.

Recommended local resources for the Slack-spine tasks:

- 8 CPUs
- 16 GB memory
- 40 GB free disk

If your machine cannot run that comfortably, use the remote path in
[Remote Sandbox Quickstart](#remote-sandbox-quickstart). The supported remote
route is direct Harbor on Daytona with `k3s` inside the sandbox.

For either path, check:

```bash
uv --version
```

For remote Daytona runs, also check:

```bash
test -n "${DAYTONA_API_KEY:-}" || echo "DAYTONA_API_KEY is not set"
```

For local runs, also check:

```bash
docker info >/dev/null
kind version
helm version --short
```

On macOS, start Docker Desktop if needed:

```bash
open -a Docker
docker info >/dev/null
```

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuekai/sre-world.git
cd sre-world
```

If you already have a checkout, confirm your working tree is in a state you
understand:

```bash
git status --short --branch
```

## 2. Run the Smoke Checks

```bash
./validate.sh smoke
```

For a scoped local convenience run:

```bash
./validate.sh smoke slack-spine
```

This is the cluster-free validation suite. It checks generated-task drift, Helm
rendering, substrate contracts, task chart identity, image provenance, and
leak/exploit guards. A green run ends with:

```text
PASS=...  FAIL=0
ALL GREEN
```

If this fails, fix it before going further. A local task run is much harder to
debug while the structural checks are red.

## 3. Build Local Images

Local `kind` runs side-load development images from your Docker daemon. Build
the Slack-spine images before launching a task:

```bash
./substrates/slack-spine/build.sh
```

The first build pulls several base and service images, so it can be noisy and
take a few minutes. It ends with:

```text
[build] done - built ... custom images, pulled + flattened ... stock images.
```

If a later command reports missing or wrong-architecture images, rerun this
script from the current checkout.

## 4. Dry-Run the Baseline Task

```bash
uv run python -m tools.local_run \
  --task tasks/slack-spine/base-health \
  --agent oracle \
  --job-name quickstart-oracle \
  --out jobs \
  --dry-run
```

This prints the Harbor command that would be run, without creating a cluster.
It is a quick check that the task path, substrate manifest, image overrides, and
local runner are wired correctly.

If the command cannot find `harbor`, sync the pinned dev dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

## 5. Run the Baseline Task

```bash
uv run python -m tools.local_run \
  --task tasks/slack-spine/base-health \
  --agent oracle \
  --job-name quickstart-oracle \
  --out jobs
```

What this does:

1. Creates a temporary `kind` cluster.
2. Loads the local Docker images into the cluster.
3. Installs the generated task chart with Helm.
4. Runs the built-in oracle solution.
5. Grades the post-fix soak with the deterministic verifier.
6. Deletes the temporary cluster when the run finishes.

A successful run ends with:

```text
slack-spine verifier: overall=PASS rewards={'reward': 1.0, ...}
Results written to jobs/quickstart-oracle/result.json
```

## 6. Inspect the Results

Top-level result:

```bash
cat jobs/quickstart-oracle/result.json
```

Look for one completed trial, zero errors, and reward `1.0`.

Per-trial verifier output:

```bash
cat jobs/quickstart-oracle/*/verifier/verdict.json
```

A passing baseline run should include:

```json
"overall": "PASS"
```

The oracle's actions are saved here:

```bash
cat jobs/quickstart-oracle/*/agent/oracle.txt
```

## 7. Remote Sandbox Quickstart

Use this path when you can edit the repo locally but cannot run the full
Docker/kind environment. It runs Harbor directly against Daytona, with `k3s`
inside the Daytona sandbox. The baseline task below verifies the hosted plumbing;
it is a health-capture harness, not a scoreable benchmark scenario.

Install the dev dependencies and Daytona SDK:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv pip install "daytona>=0.184.0"
```

Confirm credentials are available:

```bash
test -n "${DAYTONA_API_KEY:-}" || {
  echo "DAYTONA_API_KEY is not set"
  exit 1
}
```

Run one remote oracle trial:

```bash
uv run harbor run \
  -p tasks/slack-spine/00-BASE-health \
  -e daytona \
  -a oracle \
  --job-name daytona-oracle \
  --jobs-dir jobs \
  --n-concurrent 1 \
  --environment-kwarg launcher=k3s
```

Inspect the result:

```bash
cat jobs/daytona-oracle/result.json
cat jobs/daytona-oracle/*/verifier/rundir/verdict.json
```

Expected result:

```text
overall=PASS
reward=1.0
```

The final PR gate submits one Oddish experiment against the exact PR SHA with
seven trials: one oracle, one nop, and five `claude-code` trials using
`fireworks/glm-5p2`. The oracle must produce reward `1`, the nop must produce
reward `0`, and all five GLM trials must finish cleanly with rewards. Their mean
reward must be between `0.00` and `0.20`, inclusive—equivalent to zero or one
solve when rewards are binary.

This is separate from Blacksmith calibration, which intentionally retains
three golden and three nop kind trials to measure policy-v2 bands.

For an explicitly selected release-finalization run, the fixed combined mode
adds five `grok-build` / `xai/grok-4.5` trials to that same experiment and
requires complete pulled artifacts plus exact task-shipped offline verdict and
reward equality. The ordinary task gate remains the seven-trial mode above.

## 7b. Run a Pinned Task Locally (Kind, published images)

To run a generated task exactly as hosted (its digest-pinned images, not `:dev`
builds) on a laptop, use the repo's Kind environment. It creates the cluster with
the k3s service subnet the chart pins (`agentDnsFilter` uses `10.43.0.53`); the
stock `-e helm` environment uses `10.96.0.0/16` and the install fails with
"failed to allocate IP 10.43.0.53". It also replaces kindnet with a pinned
Calico, because kindnet drops replies to pods under the chart's Ingress
NetworkPolicies (docs/plans/2026-10-07-kind-calico.md):

```bash
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" uv run harbor run -p tasks/slack-spine/06-F3-split-sequencer \
  -e tools.run_verifier_v2_matrix:SlackSpineKindHelmEnvironment \
  --ek helm_timeout=1800s -a oracle --yes --job-name pinned-oracle -o jobs
```

- Use the repo-pinned Harbor (`uv run harbor`). An upstream `harbor` on PATH
  cannot install Helm-chart tasks ("has no environment definition").
- Images are amd64. On Apple Silicon, enable Rosetta in Docker/OrbStack; give the
  VM at least 8 CPUs and 16 GB. Emulated bring-up is slow, hence the longer
  `helm_timeout` (pods otherwise miss readiness before Helm gives up).
- `ghcr.io/yuekai/sre-world/*` packages must be public for a cluster to pull them
  anonymously (GitHub UI → package settings). Slack and codex-tools are; Frappe
  and Saleor are not yet.
- Cluster bring-up downloads the Calico manifest and its images, so the host
  needs internet access.

## 8. Troubleshooting

Docker is not running:

```text
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon
```

Start Docker and rerun the command.

Local images are missing:

```text
image preflight FAILED
absent (rebuild): ...
```

Rebuild:

```bash
./substrates/slack-spine/build.sh
```

The run is quiet for a while:

Harbor may not print much while it creates the cluster, loads images, or waits
for Helm. Check the job log:

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' jobs/quickstart-oracle/job.log
```

If the cluster is still running, inspect Kubernetes directly:

```bash
kind get clusters
TRIAL_DIR="$(find jobs/quickstart-oracle -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | head -1)"
KUBECONFIG="$TRIAL_DIR/helm-env.kubeconfig" kubectl get pods -n default
KUBECONFIG="$TRIAL_DIR/helm-env.kubeconfig" kubectl get events -n default --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -40
```

Early readiness and liveness warnings can be normal while the services start.
Pods that stay pending, crashloop, or fail image pulls usually point to Docker
resource limits or missing local images.

A cluster was left behind:

```bash
kind get clusters
kind delete cluster --name <cluster-name>
```

## 9. Author Your First Scenario

Tasks under `tasks/` are generated. Do not edit them by hand.

Authoring source lives under:

```text
scenarios/<substrate>/<id>/
```

Every spec has a short semantic `slug`, such as `maintenance-collision`,
`split-sequencer`, or `seq-lock-leak`. Use that slug in `task_dev`, `/grade`, and
`/calibrate`; you do not need to memorize the older coded directory id. Existing
directory ids stay unchanged so prior evidence and external task references
remain valid. For a new task, use the semantic slug for both `id` and `slug`—do
not create another catalog or difficulty code.

Each scenario has four hand-written files:

```text
spec.yaml
instruction.md
solve.sh
ground-truth.yaml
```

For a Slack-spine config fault, copy the closest retained scenario and simplify it:

```bash
cp -R scenarios/slack-spine/06-F3-split-sequencer scenarios/slack-spine/<your-id>
```

Then edit the four files. In `spec.yaml`, update at least:

- `id`
- `task.name`
- `task.scenario`
- `task.metadata`
- `fault`

Keep `instruction.md` symptom-focused. It should describe what the operator sees,
not the root cause or fix.

Generate the task:

```bash
uv run python -m tools.generate_tasks slack-spine/<your-id>
```

Run the structural checks:

```bash
./validate.sh smoke
```

When the task is structurally sound, calibrate it:

```bash
./substrates/slack-spine/build.sh
uv run python -m tools.calibrate slack-spine/<your-id> --golden 3 --nop 3
```

A scored task needs golden trials to pass and no-op trials to fail. Keep
`thresholds.provisional: true` until calibration proves FP=FN=0.
