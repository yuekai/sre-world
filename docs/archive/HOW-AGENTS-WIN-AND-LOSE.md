> **Archived 2026-10-07.** Historical: trajectory evidence as of 2026-09-02 for a ~57-task corpus; the reconstruction ships 20 of them. Kept for the record; do not update. Current docs are indexed in [docs/README.md](../README.md).

# How agents win and lose — trajectory evidence for every task

*Full-corpus validity and win/loss report · evidence as of 2026-09-02.*

**Scope.** Every task scenario in this repository (≈57 across frappe, slack-spine, saleor-spine) plus the two
in-flight feature-branch tasks (saleor `22-storefront-stalls-under-load`, the reschedule-gloss variants). For each
task with trial evidence: whether its evidence is *valid* (failures earned by the agent, not manufactured by the
harness; fault armed; environment live), and how agents *win* and *lose* on it, bucketed from parsed trajectories.

**Counting basis (applies to every number here).** A trial counts iff its episode completed (the environment's
own `episode_done` marker) and it carries an earned verdict from the verifier's files. A killed/cancelled/
bootstrap-failed trial has **no verdict — it is a null, never a fail**. All bucket tallies below come from
structured records (per-check verdicts, submitted incident reports, parsed tool_calls) — never from text searches
over logs. Where an agent transcript was destroyed by the platform's retry defect but the verdict files survive,
the trial is counted and marked *transcript-lost*.

**Bucket taxonomy.**
Losses: **(a)** never-diagnosed (agent never inspected the true fault surface) · **(b)** diagnosed-not-repaired
(named the area; repair absent/wrong/incomplete) · **(c)** repaired-but-misnamed (system genuinely fixed and held;
report named a different component than the answer key) · **(d)** timeout / never-filed a report · **(e)** suspected
task defect (an observable the diagnosis needs is missing or misleading).
Wins: **W1** clean-solve (diagnose → minimal repair → correct naming) · **W2** broad-search-solve (extensive
exploration, correct end-to-end) · **W3** repair-first (fixed early, report written from the fix) · **W4**
near-miss-pass (passed with slack — alternate accepted name, extra-but-in-scope mutations).

## 1. The counted set (15 merged discriminating + 2 pre-existing)

Rates are episode-completion counted, calibration-backed, on current merged bytes.

Cross-model gradient worth naming: RR-drift is zero on glm (0/7) and sonnet (0/4) and in-band only on opus
(0.20-0.33 across two cohorts) — the task separates model tiers on a role-scoped-configuration diagnosis, which is
the shape a difficulty-frontier benchmark task should have.

### 1a. Fail-side validity audit (harness-failure screen)

**Result: 15 of 15 counted tasks have fully sound certifying evidence.** Every counted failing trial (47 across
the certifying cohorts) was re-derived from the verifier's own structured records: episode-complete, reward 0
earned from named verdict checks, agent demonstrably acting in a live environment, fault demonstrably live.
Positive controls ran first and reproduced (RR-drift confirm → exactly 1/4; saleor gpt → exactly the known
all-repaired-but-misnamed 0/4 + 1 excluded bring-up death). Re-derived counted/passes matched the register on
all 24 cohorts, zero mismatches.

Pre-existing rows: QE1 [1784bc5e](https://www.oddish.app/experiments/1784bc5e) (5/3) and queue-write-guard [0650d1d0](https://www.oddish.app/experiments/0650d1d0) (4/3) — fails earned, fault armed, SOUND.

Cross-cutting facts: all 30 killed-after-completion counted fails finished via the agent's own declaration
(kills never censored counted work); kills hit passes and fails alike; every trial ran on a distinct EC2 host
(no shared-host clustering); the 3 bring-up deaths were excluded, never booked as zeros. **Unresolved count: 4**
(one grok cohort's status unreadable; transcript-lost trials' tool-call logs unrecoverable though structural
action evidence stands; wave-2 sweep counts cache-based pending official reads; logins-unread arming is
inference-based). Full audit: lab notes `2026-09-02-validity-root-cause-audit.md`.

### 1b. Win/loss buckets per counted task

Parsed from 108 counted trials (43 wins / 65 losses / 2 nulls). *tx-lost* = transcript destroyed by the platform
retry after the episode completed; the win is bucketed from the verifier's own records and disclosed.

| task (model) | n | wins | losses (a/b/c/d/e) | dominant win | dominant loss |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| compliance-window (glm) | 9 | W1×5 (all tx-lost) | 2/1/1/0/0 | copy sibling pool config (5 identical values) | split |
| logins-unread (glm) | 9 | W2×1 | 4/0/4/0/0 | admin-event discovery → cache-policy mapping | never-diagnosed = misnamed split |
| retry-storm (glm) | 10 | W1×1 (tx-lost) | 7/2/0/0/0 | exact both-leg mechanism incl. stuck config-watch | settings-cache decoy |
| XID (glm) | 5 | W1×3, W2×1 (2 tx-lost) | 0/0/1/0/0 | ROLLBACK PREPARED + VACUUM FREEZE, exact 2PC gid | over-attribution |
| RR-drift (opus, 2 cohorts) | 10 | W2×2 | 2/1/4/1/0 | pg_db_role_setting query + RESET + session refresh (both winners independently) | app-layer mitigation, misnamed |
| connections-and-jobs-fail (glm) | 5 | W1×2, W2×1 (1 tx-lost) | 0/2/0/0/0 | two-leg fix via sanctioned helper | queue leg didn't take |
| connections-and-queue-oom (glm) | 5 | W1×4 (all tx-lost) | 1/0/0/0/0 | both pairs, numeric mechanisms | wrong mariadb knob |
| saves-fail-and-refusals (glm) | 5 | W1×3 | 1/1/0/0/0 | read_only probe → SET GLOBAL | non-persistent repair |
| deletes-and-jobs-fail (glm) | 4 (+1 null) | W1×2 | 1/1/0/0/0 | SHOW GRANTS diff → GRANT DELETE | split |
| writes-and-jobs-fail (glm) | 5 | W1×3 | 2/0/0/0/0 | helper rejects 0 → root SQL fallback | one pair of two |
| desk-and-queue-outage (gpt) | 5 | W1×2 | 3/0/0/0/0 | 16-call compound helper repair | scheduler.tick decoy ×3 |
| desk-and-queue-oom (glm) | 5 | W1×1 | 4/0/0/0/0 | RESP probe both legs | queue leg missed ×4 |
| sends-slow-…-crawls (gpt) | 5 | W1×1 | 1/1/2/0/0 | pool restart + admin-event clear, both pairs | second-pair misname |
| desk-api-crawls (glm) | 7 | W2×2 | 5/0/0/0/0 | TTFB timing + general_log → init_connect | web-tier misread ×5 |
| notifications-vanish-silently (saleor, glm) | 7 | W1×1 (tx-lost) | 0/0/6/0/0 | exact trigger mechanism + schema-objects | 6/6 same correct mechanism, wrong vocabulary pick |
| QE1-rq-eviction-trap (gpt, 2 cohorts) | 8 | W1×4, W2×1 | 3/0/0/0/0 | RESP CONFIG SET maxmemory + probe | frappe-web.db-conn decoy (identical across eras) |
| queue-write-guard (glm) | 4 (+1 null) | W1×3 | 0/1/0/0/0 | min-replicas-to-write via sanctioned helper | repair didn't take |

**Totals: W1=35, W2=8, W3=0, W4=0 · losses a=36, b=10, c=18, d=1, e=0.** Re-derived pass counts match the
register exactly on every task. Three structural findings:
- **Nobody repairs first** (W3=0): every win runs diagnosis → repair → report in order.
- **W2 (broad search) appears exactly where the fault is invisible to standard captures** — role-attached DB
  settings, init_connect, admin events, prepared transactions — and the winning move is a catalog/timing query
  most agents never issue. That is the difficulty frontier in one sentence.
- **18 of 65 losses fully restored the system and lost on component-vocabulary mapping alone** (silent-rung: 6
  of 6 losses). Naming discipline is a real graded skill here, and also the main "one notch too strict?" watch item.

## 2. Live convert candidates (feature branches)

**saleor 22-storefront-stalls-under-load** (branch feat/saleor-storefront-conn-cap; two-sided CI calibration
green: scripted repair 3/3 pass, do-nothing 3/3 fail). Trajectory evidence (6 counted agent trials): every loss is
class **(c)** — the agents found the role connection cap via pg_roles, repaired it correctly over the admin DSN
(`CONNECTION LIMIT -1`), the storefront recovered and held through the soak window (safe_repair 1.0) — and then
named `postgres.privileges` instead of the blessed `saleor-api.db-conn` / `postgres.config`. The answer key stays
strict: a connection limit is a role attribute, not a privilege, and widening the key would flip the task to
saturated on both tested models. **Correction (2026-09-02): an earlier read reported "opus 2/2 passes" on this
task — those two rows were platform QA/audit probe jobs polluting the task view, not agent episodes (see §5,
class 7). Opus has NO agent evidence on this task yet**; the first real opus cohort is queued behind pool quota.
The convert hypothesis (a stronger tier clears the naming bar the way it does elsewhere) is untested, not
confirmed.

**Reschedule-gloss pair** (branch feat/slack-reschedule-observable; both tasks re-fenced green at v13).
Evidence trail: on `06-sends-slow-and-stall-every-minute`, diagnosis was already SOLVED (5/5 opus agents named
both true components) and 0/9 trials across the pair ever attempted the one graded repair — rescheduling the
maintenance window's offset out of the write peak; every attempt was a disable, which grading correctly rejects
(`maintenance_functional.enabled`). The fix under test is a one-line agent-visible vocabulary gloss stating the
schedule (period/offset/duration) is operator-adjustable at runtime — the affordance, not the answer. First
post-gloss screen: 0/2 on opus; per the pre-registered protocol the decision metric is whether agents now
*attempt* the reschedule (parsed from tool_calls), which the fail-side audit is extracting.

Post-gloss screen diagnosis ([c449bc97](https://www.oddish.app/experiments/c449bc97), opus, 0/2 — both fails earned): **reschedule attempt-rate moved from
0/9 pre-gloss to 1/2 post-gloss** — one agent sent PUT/POST/PATCH probes carrying `offset_seconds` payloads at
the maintenance service (attempted the right repair class, did not land it); the other only reconnoitered before
repairing the pool leg. The observable demonstrably changes behavior; the remaining gap is completing the call,
not knowing it exists. Disposition: sibling task's screen proceeds; this task gets a small top-up before any
further design change.

---

## 3. Frontier-hard set (valid, uniformly zero — non-counting by design)

Calibration-green tasks (scripted repair passes; do-nothing fails) on which **every tested model tier scores
zero**. These map the upper edge of current agent capability; their zeros are earned, with parsed-trajectory
failure stories:

| task | models at zero | dominant loss mode (from trajectories) |
|---|---|---|
| 06-F3-split-sequencer (slack) | glm 4/0 · opus 5/0 · gpt 5/0 · grok 0/2 (partial) | (b): agents switch sequencer mode correctly, then fail the lossless re-sequence of duplicate rows + restart-survival challenge; goodput is all-or-nothing while any duplicate remains |
| 06-sends-slow-and-history-out-of-order (slack) | glm 6/0 · opus 5/0 · gpt 5/0 · grok 0/2 (partial) | (b): both fault pairs named (4/5), neither leg fully repaired; stacks the sequencer wall on a db-pool leg |
| 06-sends-crawl-then-store-slows (slack) | glm 3/0 · opus 5/0 · gpt 5/0 | under-diagnosis of a 3-leg compound; no trial named the third leg |
| 06-logins-and-sends-slow (slack) | glm 3/0 · opus 3c+2b | (c)+(b) mixed: 3/5 repaired the store-hold but misnamed (`redis.cache-policy` vs `auth.session-store-client`); conversion needs BOTH naming widening AND the report-shape gate relaxed — held |
| 06-stall-every-minute-and-later-every-send-crawls (slack) | glm 3/0 · opus 4b+1null | (b): the 0/9 reschedule wall (see §2) |
| 06-sends-slow-and-stall-every-minute (slack) | glm 3/0 · opus 5b | (b): diagnosis perfect, repair wall (see §2) |
| 06-sends-slow-and-later-every-send-crawls-reported (slack, no-fault twin) | glm 3/0 · opus 5b | over-diagnosis: agents primed to find faults mutate healthy settings (hold_ms) instead of filing no-fault-found |
| 06-saves-refused-and-jobs-rejected (frappe) | glm 3/0 · opus 3b+2d | (b) over-attribution to a tier that is dead-by-design substrate-wide, + (d): 2/5 never FOUND the report-filing CLI (discoverability, not capability) |
| 06-sends-fail-after-strict-mode-plausible-pool (slack) | glm+gpt+opus all 0/n | confident diverse fabrication (named wrong components; none reported the sentinel) |
| 06-sends-fail-after-strict-mode-turns-on (slack) | glm+gpt+opus all 0/n | same class; vocabulary glosses tried and refuted at n=5 |
| 07-writes-and-queue-oom (frappe) | glm+gpt+opus all 0/n | model-independent structural zero |
| 07-deletes-refused-and-jobs-stalled (frappe false-alarm) | glm+sonnet+opus 0/n | fabrication under a convincing-but-healthy symptom; agents READ the no-fault vocabulary entry and fabricated anyway |

One positive control on the "broken vs hard" question: the suspected class-(e) defect in `saves-refused-and-jobs-
rejected` (worker count reads zero) was OVERTURNED by comparing against the healthy base-health scenario and a
real-fault twin — the zero-worker shape is the substrate-wide baseline, not a lying observable. No confirmed
class-(e) defect stands anywhere in the corpus as of this report.

## 4. Saturated set (valid, too easy — every agent passes; non-counting)

F1-connection-cap (5/5, current bytes) · mariadb-read-only (5/5, current bytes) · U1-user-conn-cap (re-graded
3/3) · queue-lag-bait (4/4 after kill-recount) · readonly-flag-fog (3/3) · deletes-and-queue-oom (5/5) ·
webhook-deliveries-refused (glm 5/5 + gpt 5/5) · edits-refused, deletes-refused, job-submissions-fail,
new-records-refused, 07-edits-and-queue-oom (3/3-class, older bytes). Dominant win mode: W1 — the symptom names
the cause (the lesson that produced the harder saleor ladder rung, which landed 0.14 in-band). F1 and
mariadb-read-only discriminated on the pre-[#434](https://github.com/abundant-ai/sre-world/pull/434) environment and saturated when re-measured on current bytes —
those rows are marked superseded in the register, not carried.

## 5. Harness-failure taxonomy (what a "failure" can be that is NOT agent evidence)

Every class below was OBSERVED in this corpus's history and is excluded from counts by the episode-completion rule:

1. **Quota cancellation** — "Cancelled because quota was reached": org concurrency ceiling; trials die pre- or
   mid-run with no verdict. Last night's model sweep lost ~9 cohorts to this (§6). Nulls.
2. **Bootstrap/bring-up death** — "Failed to bootstrap Kubernetes tools", helm timeouts: environment never
   reached ready; the fault never armed. Nulls (a 5/5-death cohort is VOID, not zero).
3. **Shared-key rate-limit storms** — stacked launches on one model key kill running agents (exit 137);
   post-completion kills even destroy transcripts of successful runs (verdict survives in verifier files —
   transcript-lost passes are disclosed per cohort).
4. **Retry transcript destruction** — the platform's retry overwrites the killed process's transcript,
   including after success. Counting therefore keys on the verifier's own files, never on transcript presence.
5. **Fault-arming races** — a trial graded against a fault that wasn't live when the agent's clock started;
   guarded by typed episode-ready gates (the XID fault-init restart-window fix is the worked example).
6. **Provider capacity mis-routing** — trials launched without the explicit compute environment die on provider
   capacity and say nothing about the task.
7. **Probe/annotation pollution** — the platform runs QA and source-audit probe jobs against tasks; they appear
   in task views alongside agent trials and can read as passes (this produced a retracted "opus 2/2" on
   saleor-22), and the QA probe's `analysis` field has written "reward 1.0, legitimate_solution" onto trials
   whose official verdict is 0.0. Counting therefore keys on `verdict.json` + trial kind=agent, never on task-view
   rows or platform analysis fields.

**Reading the oddish UI against this taxonomy — "errored" is NOT "invalid".** The experiment pages flag a
trial "errored" whenever the platform killed its process, *including kills that landed after the episode
completed and the verdict was earned* (class 3/4 above). Worked example: in
[afec2901](https://www.oddish.app/experiments/afec2901) (logins-unread), trial `…-7f4492c5-7` shows errored on
the UI with `Command failed (exit 137) … stderr: Killed` — but the killed command line contains `--continue`,
i.e. it is the platform's *retry* invocation, fired after the kill. The trial's verifier records show the episode
was already over before any of that: the agent declared at t=1219 s, the soak window ran to t=1340 s
(`completion_reason: declared_soak_complete`), the agent's incident report is on disk (it named
`auth.jwks-cache`; the key expected `redis.cache-policy`), and the reward 0.0 is earned from named checks —
wrong diagnosis and four latency checks still failing at declare+soak. The kill destroyed the transcript, not
the verdict: a valid counted failure. A trial is *invalid* (excluded from the denominator) only when the episode never
completed: bring-up death, quota cancel, mid-run kill before declaration. Across all certifying cohorts there
are exactly two such nulls (deletes-and-jobs-fail +1, queue-write-guard +1 — both rows publish n excluding
them). Same-bytes top-ups to refill null slots are only possible while the task's uploaded bytes still match
the certified version; shared verifier-bundle growth from later merges can retire that option (it has, for both
null-carrying cohorts) without affecting the certified counts, which remain ≥3 counted trials each.

Related integrity check (clean): `/solution` is mounted in agent pods but contains only a 391-byte dispatcher —
the actual fix is never staged for real-agent runs. A corpus-wide structured scan of tool calls found 8 trials
probing it (41 file hits, each inspected); none obtained graded information and no counted pass is contaminated.

**Audit headline for this section: 15/15 counted tasks' certifying evidence is fully sound** — no harness
failure is booked anywhere as an agent failure (verified trial-by-trial; §1a). The taxonomy above is what the
counting rule exists to exclude, and the audit confirms it did.

## 6. Evidence-void ledger (nulls awaiting re-run, as of this report)

Quota-voided last night (no verdicts, nothing counted): gpt cohorts on logins-and-sends-slow (4/5 errored),
stall-every-minute-and-later (5/5), sends-slow-and-stall-every-minute (5/5), sends-slow-and-later-…-reported
(5/5), saves-refused-and-jobs-rejected (5/5) · grok cohorts on crawl-then-store (5/5), logins-and-sends-slow
(5/5), stall-…-crawls (5/5), sends-slow-and-stall (5/5), later-crawls-reported (5/5) · the saleor opus top-up
(3/3) · one grok launch rejected at submission (saves-refused). Re-run queue drains as pool quota frees; none of
these appear as zeros anywhere in this report or the register.

## 7. Known open defects (tracked, not silent)

- 09-I1-seq-lock-leak and 13-P1-distractor-volume-shell (slack): merged tasks whose whole-file layers sit 120-170
  lines behind base source (silently reverting real code). A drift gate now blocks recurrence ([#454](https://github.com/abundant-ai/sre-world/pull/454)); both need

## 8. The pre-existing thirteen — what happened to the pre-sprint corpus

Thirteen task scenarios existed on main before the sprint (verified at the 2026-08-25 snapshot, commit
a18699eb5): seven frappe, six slack. None were deleted or renamed. Their full disposition:

| pre-existing task | peak status | status now | what happened |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1-connection-cap | in-band 0.60 | saturated 5/5 ([261d4ce0](https://www.oddish.app/experiments/261d4ce0)) | environment fix (below) |
| U1-user-conn-cap | in-band 0.80 | saturated 3/3 | cohort re-grade correction |
| mariadb-read-only | in-band 0.50 | saturated 5/5 ([0f665d7f](https://www.oddish.app/experiments/0f665d7f)) | environment fix |
| queue-lag-bait | in-band 0.80 | saturated 4/4 → 5/5 | a platform kill had been booked as an agent miss |
| readonly-flag-fog | — | saturated 3/3 | symptom names the cause |
| QE1-rq-eviction-trap | in-band | **in-band 0.60 ✓** ([1784bc5e](https://www.oddish.app/experiments/1784bc5e)) | survived re-measure on current bytes |
| queue-write-guard | in-band | **in-band 0.75 ✓** ([0650d1d0](https://www.oddish.app/experiments/0650d1d0)) | survived |
| F3-split-sequencer | zero | frontier-zero, 3 model families | always too hard (§3) |
| F4-maintenance-collision | — | never measured | fault-shaped, profiled, no counted cohort ever |
| I1-seq-lock-leak | measured | quarantined | layer-drift defect (§7) |
| P1-distractor-volume-shell | measured | quarantined | layer-drift defect (§7) |
| SV1-pool-exhaustion-shell | — | never materialized | scenario shell, no task dir |
| BC1-seq-lock-leak-build | — | blocked | base-release receipt bootstrap gap (§7) |

The mechanism behind the 6-in-band → 2 drop: the old in-band rates were measured on the pre-#434 environment,
where the agent's egress proxy fabricated 403 errors on genuinely reachable services — agents were partly
fighting a broken proxy, which made easy tasks read as discriminating. Re-measured on the honest environment,
F1 and mariadb-read-only went straight to 5/5; two more exits were counting corrections (a kill booked as a
miss; a re-grade). Nothing pre-existing was lost — what vanished were inflated measurements of it.
