> **Archived 2026-10-07.** Historical: a 2026-08 backlog of task-pipeline improvements for the original; open debt for this fork lives in docs/plans/tech-debt.md. Kept for the record; do not update. Current docs are indexed in [docs/README.md](../README.md).

# Task-quality pipeline improvements

Things the three source papers argue for — or that scoring four scenarios against
[`TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md`](../TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md) exposed — that the pipeline does not do
yet. Each item states what is argued, what we do today, what it would take, and what it
would cost. They are suggestions, not commitments; nothing here changes what an author
must do to ship a scenario. Paper short names (DG / SG / AX) and citation style are the
rubric's.

Ranking by value-for-cost is at the end (§12).

---

## 1. Frappe minimality capture sources beyond the MariaDB ConfigMap

**Argued.** SG's oracles are state-based and problem-specific so that "every SRE problem has
underlying defects for the agent to diagnose and resolve" and a wrong action on live state
is seen (App. B; repo `mitigation.py`). The rubric's A3.

**Today.** `substrates/frappe/grader_hooks.py::DEFAULT_CAPTURE_SOURCE` captures exactly one
path, the MariaDB `my.cnf` ConfigMap → `sut/config/mariadb.yaml`. Any
`minimality.allowed_keys_by_component` entry that names a Redis (`redis-queue.maxmemory`) or
worker key is never diffed; 03-QE1's LRU-flip trap and its own `golden_fix` are invisible to
the minimality gate (PR #229 body, "Known gap, not introduced here"). MariaDB runtime state
is covered separately by `mariadb_state` probes; nothing equivalent exists for Redis
`CONFIG GET` or worker replica counts.

**What it would take.** A `minimality.capture_sources` (or per-substrate capture hook list)
that renders additional semantic paths from live state — e.g. `redis-cli CONFIG GET
maxmemory maxmemory-policy` per instance → `sut/values/redis-<name>.yaml`, `replicaCount`
per worker from the Deployment → `sut/values/workers.yaml` — captured at the same three
phases. Changes: `substrates/frappe/grader_hooks.py` (capture), the Frappe loadgen sidecar
collector, `tools/check_task_consistency.py` (HARD: every allow-list key must sit under a
captured path), `docs/AUTHORING-FRAPPE.md` §3.

**Cost.** Substrate code under `build_inputs` → moves `base_fingerprint`/grader fingerprints
→ recalibrate the Frappe catalogue (currently 2–3 tasks; ~6 trials each on Blacksmith).
Not a profile change, so no base release. Medium.

**Value.** High: unblocks every Frappe fault family other than MariaDB (the redis families
were just added to the validator in #227) from having an enforceable trap. Without it,
A3 is ❌ for all of them by construction.

## 2. A `wrong-report-valid-repair` counterexample case, and a matrix Frappe can run

**Argued.** SG validates every problem by executing the oracle in both states before merge
(`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `tests/integration/validate_problem.py`) and documents the
restart-loop and injector-disable exploits (App. B); AX screens tests "without reward
hacking" (§3.1). Rubric B3.

**Today.** `tools/run_verifier_v2_matrix.py` has 12 `STANDARD_CASES` but **no case where the
repair is correct and the attribution is wrong** — `perfect-report-wrong` is the inverse.
That missing case is exactly the #234 defect (component not graded). The matrix is also
verifier-v2 only; Frappe's 03-QE1 is v1 and 03-F1/03-U1, though v2, ship no
`qualification/`. The runner drives kind via `HelmEnvironment`/`KindLauncher` and validates
trial captures, so in principle it runs on Frappe — nobody has tried.

**What it would take.** (a) Add `wrong-report-valid-repair` to `STANDARD_CASES` with
`expected: {outcome: 1, safe_repair: 1, overall: FAIL}` under the v2 contract (the report
check lives in `outcome.checks`, so the expected vector needs care — today a wrong component
fails `outcome`, which is the right verdict but worth pinning). (b) Author
`qualification/matrix.yaml` + ~8 case scripts for 03-F1 and 03-U1 (reference, no-op,
restart-only, the decoy, wrong-report-valid-repair, paraphrased-report-valid,
endpoint-bypass, traffic-suppression) and run the matrix on Blacksmith. (c) Either migrate
03-QE1 to a `verification:` block or accept that v1 scenarios cannot have an executed
matrix and say so in AUTHORING-FRAPPE.

**Cost.** (a) small, tools-only, no fingerprint movement if the runner is host-side (verify
— `run_verifier_v2_matrix.py` imports `tools.regrade` and `tools.verifier_v2`; the latter
is part of the stamped source closure, so a contract change may move the grader
fingerprint). (b) ~1 day per scenario plus ~8 kind trials each. (c) 03-QE1 rewrite ≈ one
authoring pass plus recalibration.

**Value.** High: converts "a trap asserted in prose" into an executed control for Frappe
and adds the one standard case the worked example needed.

## 3. A margin assertion in the calibration fence

**Argued.** DG grades against a recorded baseline with explicit 30–50% thresholds and
reports run-to-run σ (§4.3; repo e2e README §5.4); AX averages three epochs and shows how
much a small-n fence moves (App. B); SG runs each problem three times. Rubric C3.

**Today.** `tools/calibrate.py` prints golden/nop spreads and fits bands at golden-max + 10
pt / golden-min − 20 pt, and only the *delivery* channel refuses a floor when nop-max is too
close to golden-min. The error/goodput fence is binary: 3/3 + 3/3 passes whether the gap is
0.9 vs 0.1 or 0.11 vs 0.02 (03-QE1's `rq_enqueue`). *Update (#279):* the fence is no longer
health-bands-only — calibration policy v2 now runs unconditionally on the reporting path
(a nop that fails only the incident-report checks does not discriminate) and a failed
fence fails the `calibrate` run. That closes the semantic-discrimination hole; the
*numeric margin* assertion below is still not implemented.

**What it would take.** In `calibrate.py`'s summary: compute, per discriminating signal, the
gap between golden-min and nop-max as a fraction of the fitted band width and the golden's
absolute health (aggregate goodput/error vs the substrate health record); print both;
fail the fence (or emit a loud `MARGIN` warning written into the calibration evidence
artefact) when the gap is below a policy constant or the golden itself is below the health
record's own bands. Surface the number in the `/calibrate` PR comment.

**Cost.** ~50–100 lines in `tools/calibrate.py` + `tools/calibration_policy.py`, tests.
Host-side only — no fingerprint movement, no release. Small.

**Value.** Medium-high: it is the cheapest way to stop a razor-thin fence from reading as a
calibrated task, and it gives the C3 row a number instead of a reading.

## 4. Extend the leak lint to `instruction.md` literals

**Argued.** AX checks "that task prompts align with the source documents" and withholds the
failing test (§3.1, §4.1); DG rejects trivially-observable faults (§3.3). Rubric B1.

**Today.** `tools/lint_scenario.py` scans the agent-visible image and the obs template; its
docstring excludes `instruction.md` as curated prose. The only instruction checks are
`/grade` (advisory, paid) and review. The rubric found steers in three of four instructions.

**What it would take.** A second, narrower pass in `lint_scenario.py` over
`scenarios/<sub>/<id>/instruction.md`: per-scenario literals only (answer component leaf,
`fault.injected` / `golden_fix` keys and values co-occurring with their knob, and
`mechanism_keywords`), **not** the framing-word list (instructions legitimately say "fix"
and "report"). WARN first, HARD after the catalogue is clean. Exempt the
`submit_incident_report --help` pointer.

**Cost.** Small (tools only). Risk: false positives where a vocabulary token is legitimately
mentioned; mitigated by exempting the registry when `report_vocabulary` is on.

**Value.** Medium: catches the mechanical leak class; cannot catch direction/steer prose,
which stays with `/grade` and review.

## 5. Real-agent difficulty evidence for Frappe

**Argued.** SG: ported problems saturate above 80% and SG-native ones fall to 17.9% E2E —
the benchmark reports which is which (§3.2, Table 4); AX treats "all models fail to reliably
solve" as a design goal (§1); DG validates that 17% of failures are "inherently difficult"
(§4.2). Rubric C4.

**Today.** The GLM cohort band (`tools/oddish_qualification.py`, mean in `(0.00, 0.60]` over five
trials) is the mechanism, but it runs only under automatic qualification, which Frappe
(`qualification.automatic: false`) does not have. 03-QE1 has one local Opus-5 trial on
record; 03-F1 and 03-U1 have none. `LESSONS.md` records that real-agent trials on an
m6i.2xlarge OOM-kill the CLI.

**What it would take.** Until the automatic gate lifts: a convention (AUTHORING-FRAPPE §10)
that `REVIEWER.md` records at least one `tools/local_run.py --agent claude-code` (or GLM via
Fireworks) trial with model, budget, reward and a three-line transcript summary; a
`REVIEWER.md` template section. After: nothing — the cohort runs.

**Cost.** Per scenario ≈ 30–60 min wall clock and single-digit dollars on a 64 GB box;
author time to write up. No infra change.

**Value.** Medium: it is the only pre-merge signal that a scenario is not solved by the
first reflex, and it is what makes the "controlled difficulty instrument" claim (D1) more
than metadata.

## 6. Operational causal distance

**Argued.** SG's localization dimension distinguishes origin from "downstream victims" and
its compound faults hide the constraint where no trace shows it (§2.5, App. D.1); AX
measures a 20.9-point single-vs-multi-service gap (§7). `DECISIONS.md` D1 obliges causal
distance to be "operationally defined and measurable … since it is the headline". Rubric C1.

**Today.** `task.metadata.causal_distance` is a hand-typed integer; `generate_tasks.py`
copies it; nothing validates it. 03-F1 declares 3 while an exported series
(`mysql_global_variables_max_connections`) names the knob.

**What it would take.** Define hops over the substrate's `contracts/topology.yaml` (symptom
service → … → owning service/component) and a metric-surface adjustment (−1 if an exported
series names the answer knob). Add a WARN in `check_task_consistency.py` when the declared
value disagrees with the computed one; make it HARD once the catalogue agrees. Both
substrates already ship `contracts/topology.yaml` (tiers and services, not edges), so the
cost is adding dependency edges and the hop computation, not a new contract.

**Cost.** Medium: edge annotation per substrate + ~100 lines host-side. No fingerprint
movement (`contracts/` is host-side per AUTHORING-FRAPPE §7).

**Value.** Medium-high for the benchmark's positioning; low for any single scenario.

## 7. Controlled noise / distractor injection as a first-class axis

**Argued.** SG's first design principle: "A clean, quiet environment is not only unrealistic
but also hard to challenge AI … SREGym offers controlled noises, without compromising
reliable evaluation" (§2 p.3); diagnosis success "drops for every agent-model pair" under
noise (§3.1); noise is injected as real CRDs in a namespace the API proxy hides
(`sregym/generators/noise/manager.py`, `k8s_proxy.py`). AX seeds filler issues on the
project board and a 2–4% log signal-to-noise ratio (§4.1; HF dataset card).

**Today.** slack-spine has one distractor scenario (`13-P1-distractor-volume-shell`); Frappe
has none; there is no `noise:` block in the spec schema and no sidecar capability to run a
transient unrelated disturbance during the episode without it being a second fault.

**What it would take.** A spec-level `noise:` list (kind, target, schedule, duration) applied
by the loadgen sidecar from the private side, with `leak_probe.py` asserting the noise plane
is as invisible as the fault plane; outcome bands must be re-fitted with noise present (the
health record would need a noise variant or the bands widened). Substrate work on both
sides.

**Cost.** High: sidecar capability + chart overlay = `build_inputs` change → base release on
Frappe; new health captures; every noisy scenario needs its own calibration.

**Value.** High for novelty-threat parity with SG (already named in `LESSONS.md`), low until
the single-fault catalogue is larger than a handful.

## 8. A healthy-instance ("nothing is wrong") task shape

**Argued.** DG ships "Normal Cases" (14.3% of monitoring tasks) because agents "generat[e]
significant false positives by misinterpreting normal operational variance as anomalies"
(§3.3, §4.2); its label set includes `none`.

**Today.** `00-BASE-health` exists on both substrates but as a capture canary for
`capture-base-health.yaml`, not as an agent-facing task; the report schema requires a
non-null finding, so "no fault" is not a gradeable answer.

**What it would take.** A report shape that accepts a null finding, a verification contract
whose pass condition is "no mutation, no report of a fault, health bands hold", and the nop
trajectory becoming the golden. Small oracle change, moderate contract change.

**Cost.** Low-medium (oracle + generator + one scenario). No release surface.

**Value.** Medium: it is the only shape that measures false positives, which the papers
treat as a first-class failure mode and which nothing here can see.

## 9. Contamination hygiene: canary strings in generated tasks

**Argued.** DG screens repositories by prefix-completion memorisation and strips git
metadata (§3.1, App. B); AX holds out 200 of 250 tasks and stamps every released
`task.yaml` with `DO NOT USE IN TRAINING … canary GUID` (HF dataset); DG's e2e README
requires the Terminal-Bench canary in `task.yaml` and tests. SG has no contamination
mechanism at all.

**Today.** Faults are synthetic on a purpose-built SUT, so memorisation of a public incident
is not the risk; but `tasks/` is a committed, cloneable tree containing `instruction.md`
and the stamped oracle source. No canary, no held-out split.

**What it would take.** A canary GUID line in the generated `task.toml` / `instruction.md`
header emitted by `generate_tasks.py` (and recognised by `lint_scenario` as not a framing
leak). Held-out tasks would need a private publication path — out of scope.

**Cost.** Trivial for the canary (generator + one test); it changes every generated task
once (identity check re-run, no fingerprint movement if placed outside the hashed inputs —
verify). Held-out split: large.

**Value.** Low-medium now; cheap insurance if the catalogue is ever used to train.

## 10. Registry spelling-symmetry check

**Argued.** SG §2.5 on label brittleness, from the other side: if the label set is closed
and published, its *shape* must not betray the answer. Rubric B2 — 03-QE1's vocabulary
has exactly one underscore service (`redis_queue`, the answer) among hyphenated peers.

**Today.** `contracts/registry.yaml` H7 requires the canonical *answer* pair to be
underscore-form; legacy hyphen ids "report warn-only". So a scenario can be fully valid and
still publish an asymmetric vocabulary.

**What it would take.** Canonicalise the remaining Frappe registry tokens to underscore form
(scenarios + `contracts/registry.yaml`; `solve.sh`/`instruction.md` re-grep per E2), then
promote the mixed-form warning to HARD in `tools/validate_substrate_contracts.py` or
`check_task_consistency.py`, and add a WARN when a component family (`.capacity`,
`.max-user-connections`) exists on exactly one of two peer services.

**Cost.** Small code; the token migration touches every Frappe scenario's registry and
answer pair (cheap envelope: `scenarios/` + `contracts/registry.yaml`, no release) but must
be coordinated with the open PRs.

**Value.** Medium: closes a greppable-outlier channel the D7 uniformity check does not see
on Frappe.

## 11. Name-length lint (not paper-driven; found while scoring) — DONE (#257)

AUTHORING-FRAPPE §6: the ≤39-char `spec.task.name` cap "is not enforced by any lint" and
fails ~20 minutes into a cold boot. A `helm template` + longest-Service-name check in
`validate.sh render` per substrate is ~20 lines and removes a known 20-minute failure
mode. Small cost, modest value; listed for completeness.

**DONE (#257):** enforced at generation rather than in `validate.sh render` —
`generate_tasks` dies on a frappe release over the 42-char budget, and also rejects a
release containing a subchart alias (the silent Service-rename trap that burned two
fences).

---

## 13. Emitted-token grep gate — C5, F2

**What.** A deterministic check that every service/component token emitted by
`solve.sh` and `instruction.md` matches the scenario's `ground_truth` pair
character-for-character, under the oracle's own canonicalization
(`verifier/oracle/attribution.py::_canon_token` — casefold + strip leading `svc-`,
and nothing else).

**Why the papers care.** APEX §4.2 names "specification hallucination" — a model
"altered a required bucket name" or "paraphrased a required ticket title" — as a
top failure mode. Exact-name constraints are what make that gradeable, which means
*our* names must themselves be exact. SREGym §2.5 goes further and rejects
exact-label matching outright as "brittle because predefined labels are often
ambiguous and not mutually exclusive"; since D12 commits us to the exact-match
side of that argument, we own the brittleness and must fence it.

**What it would take.** Extend `tools/check_task_consistency.py` with a sixth
check: read `ground_truth.service` / `.component` (and each `ground_truth_set`
entry), scan `solve.sh` and `instruction.md` for tokens matching
`_COMPONENT_TOKEN` whose prefix is a registry service, canonicalize both sides
with the oracle's own `_canon_token`, and HARD-fail on a token that canonicalizes
to something not in the registry — or that *resembles* the answer component under
a hyphen/underscore normalization but is not equal to it under `_canon_token`.
That second clause is the actual bug class. The check is already wired into
`validate.sh` smoke, so no new CI surface.

**What it would cost.** Roughly 20 lines plus a test. No runtime cost, no
fingerprint movement, no recalibration. The only risk is false-positives on
scenarios whose `instruction.md` legitimately mentions a decoy component, which
the existing check (4) already handles by treating instruction/registry mismatch
as WARN — so the new check should HARD-fail only on the answer-component
near-miss, and WARN on everything else.

**Why it's first.** LESSONS.md records this class firing **twice in one session**
("the same bug appeared twice in one scenario: `solve.sh` and then
`instruction.md` were still emitting the hyphen form after `ground_truth` moved to
underscore"), and states plainly that "calibration cannot catch it, because golden
and nop both hardcode the same spelling." It is the only known defect class that
is simultaneously (a) silent, (b) fatal to the run's validity, and (c) invisible
to every existing gate. AUTHORING-FRAPPE §4 and §10 currently handle it by asking
the author to remember.

---

## 14. Lint runtime-tier fault values — D1

**What.** Teach the answer-key lint about runtime-tier faults, whose values are
invisible to it today.

**Why the papers care.** DevOps-Gym §3.1 strips git metadata specifically "to
prevent agents from accessing solutions through git version history" — the
principle being that *every* channel carrying the answer must be closed, not the
convenient ones. APEX §2.1 stage 2 audits suites for reward-hacking
susceptibility. Our D7 incident is the same lesson learned the expensive way.

**What it would take.** `tools/lint_scenario.py::_scenario_literals` builds its
per-scenario forbidden set from `fault.golden_fix` and `fault.injected`. A
runtime-tier scenario has **both empty by design** — `check_task_consistency`
explicitly permits the "vacuous / runtime-event fix" shape — so it contributes
zero literals and its values are never checked against the agent-visible surface.
The values live in `mariadb_state.probes.<id>.expect.{baseline,declaration}`.
Extend `_scenario_literals` to also walk `mariadb_state.probes`, emitting
`(scenario_id, probe.variable, value)` triples for each `eq` predicate under
`baseline` and `declaration` — reusing the existing `_value_hit` co-occurrence
rule so a bare `0` or `8` elsewhere is not a false positive.

**What it would cost.** ~15 lines plus a test. No runtime cost, no fingerprint
movement. Today this affects exactly one scenario (03-U1, whose faulted `8` and
repair value `0` are unlinted), but every future runtime-tier scenario inherits
the hole, and runtime tier is the substrate's newest and least-exercised plane.

---

## 15. Order base-surface merges and warn on cross-invalidation — F3, E4

**What.** Make it visible, before merge, that a PR touching a base surface
invalidates *other* scenarios' stamped calibration.

**Why the papers care.** SREGym §2 DP3/DP4 treats composability and extensibility
as first-class quality properties precisely because prior benchmarks are "hard to
extend due to their bespoke designs" — and the failure mode they describe is
per-problem coupling. Ours is subtler and arguably worse: our scenarios are
decoupled in *source* but coupled through the fingerprint that certifies their
evidence.

**What it would take.** The detection already exists —
`tools/task_dev/core.py::classify()` returns `base_release_substrates`, and
AUTHORING-FRAPPE §7 documents the pre-push check. What's missing is the
*consequence report*: when `classify()` reports a non-empty
`base_release_substrates`, enumerate every committed task on that substrate whose
stamped `calibration.base_fingerprint` will no longer match post-merge, and print
them. Surface it in the PR comment the qualification engine already posts. A
follow-on policy question — whether such a PR should be blocked, or merged with a
tracked recalibration debt — is a decision, not code.

**What it would cost.** A small tool plus a line in the existing PR comment.
No runtime cost. The recurring cost it *reveals* is the real one: a base-surface
merge implies re-running the fence for every task on that substrate (~6 trials
each, ~6–8 min per trial on kind).

**Live case.** 03-QE1 adds `frappe_dev_queue` to `loadgen_frappe/profiles.yaml`,
which is inside `base_fingerprint` — confirmed by probe, `df93d2…` → `2b06bd72…`.
Merging it invalidates 03-F1's stamped `3/3 golden · 3/3 nop`, which is currently
F1's entire claim to being eval-ready. Nothing in the pipeline says so today, and
nobody looking at either PR in isolation would notice. Both scenarios are good;
the *ordering* is the problem.

---

_Entries 13–15 come from the long-form criteria pass in [`docs/research/TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md`](../research/TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md); they reference that file's criterion ids (C5/F2, D1, F3/E4)._

## 12. Ranking by value-for-cost

1. **§3 Margin assertion in the fence** — small, host-side, no release; turns C3 into a
   number and stops 03-QE1-shaped fences from reading as calibrated.
2. **§1 Frappe minimality capture sources** — medium cost (one recalibration round), but
   it is the precondition for any non-MariaDB Frappe trap to be real (A3), including the one
   scenario already in flight.
3. **§2 `wrong-report-valid-repair` case + a Frappe-runnable matrix** — the standard-case
   addition is small and directly encodes the #234 defect; the Frappe matrix is the larger
   half and can follow.

Then, roughly: §4 instruction literal lint (small, partial coverage) · §10 registry symmetry
(small, coordination-heavy) · §5 real-agent evidence convention (author time only) · §6
operational causal distance (positioning) · §8 healthy-instance shape · §9 canary · §11
name-length lint (done, #257) · §7 noise injection (highest value, highest cost; last
because it needs the catalogue to be bigger first).
