> **Archived 2026-10-07.** Historical: describes the original's trial infrastructure (Blacksmith calibration fan-out, Daytona/Oddish), which this fork does not run. Kept for the record; do not update. Current docs are indexed in [docs/README.md](../README.md).

# Builds architecture — how trials run fast today

This doc used to be a design/backlog proposal for speeding up Daytona trial iteration ("levers A–E"). Almost none of that backlog was built as written; the bottleneck was solved differently. What follows describes only what exists in the repo today, verified against `.github/workflows/`, `tools/push_images.py`, and `substrates/*/build.sh`. The original lever analysis is summarized at the end for the record.

## Calibration: per-trial fan-out on Blacksmith (kind-native)

`.github/workflows/calibrate.yaml` runs each golden/nop trial on its own 8-vCPU / 32 GB Blacksmith runner (pinned size `blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2404` — the runner size is part of the calibration environment, so it is hard-coded, not an input). Each cell captures the verifier rundir as an artifact; a single aggregate job re-grades every capture with the real oracle (`tools/calibrate --no-run`) for FP=FN=0 and band measurement. Wall-clock collapses from sum to one trial — this is what replaced the old "local 8 GB serial ceiling."

Two ways in: `workflow_dispatch` from the Actions tab, or `workflow_call` from `calibrate-pr.yaml` when someone comments `/calibrate` on a PR. The engine is artifact-only: `write_back` survives as a deprecated safety tripwire and nothing is committed back to the PR branch (#266). A failed fence fails the run and the PR comment carries the policy-v2 reasons (#279); a passed fence is stamped into the spec afterwards by replaying its captured rundirs through `calibrate --no-run --write` (#266/#282).

## Hosted surface: Oddish-managed Daytona k3s

The shipped/release-gate execution surface is Oddish-managed Daytona k3s, not the kind runners:

- `run-trial.yaml` submits one committed hosted-canonical task through Oddish Cloud. Committed tasks are the hosted form — every image pulls from the digest-locked GHCR release baked into `task.values.yaml`, so the workflow needs no image pull/retag/side-load plumbing.
- `run-qualification-experiment.yaml` is the final PR merge surface. It submits
  one exact-SHA Oddish experiment per affected task containing one oracle, one
  nop, and five `claude-code` / `fireworks/glm-5p2` trials, then validates and
  uploads the seven-trial result as one artifact bundle. Merge qualification
  requires the GLM cohort's mean reward to be in `(0.00, 0.60]` — above zero,
  at most 0.60.
- `recal-check.yaml` is the calibration-decay alarm: weekly (Mondays 06:00 UTC), for every task the index marks `hosted_ready`, run oracle → expect PASS and nop → expect FAIL through the hosted plane. Any flip means the bands are stale. The schedule is disarmed by default — it runs only when the repository variable `RECAL_CHECK_ENABLED` is `true`, and otherwise skips loudly naming the variable; `workflow_dispatch` always runs. The matrix is capped at `max-parallel: 4` because it is 2N hosted trials (oracle + nop per task) against a corpus growing toward ~50.

## Image release pipeline

Custom images are published as immutable, digest-locked GHCR releases:

- Ordinary task development is fault-layer-first. Shared base images remain
  frozen; task-specific image bytes publish as thin content-addressed layers.
  Base candidates are reserved for exceptional substrate/framework/security
  maintenance, not routine scenario iteration.
- `substrates/<name>/build.sh` builds the substrate's custom images (fixed `:dev` tags referenced by the chart's `values.yaml`) and flattens stock images to single-arch for kind loading. Idempotent via the Docker layer cache.
- `tools/push_images.py` builds for linux/amd64 (the Daytona/k3s sandbox arch), tags `<registry>/<basename>:<release>`, pushes, and records digests in the committed `substrates/<name>/images.lock.json`. Re-pushing a release with different digests is refused — bump `images.release` instead. `tools/generate_tasks.py` refuses to stamp hosted tasks unless the lock exists and matches the manifest's `images.release`.
- `task-ci.yaml` is the credential-free PR workflow. Its manifest-driven impact matrix builds only affected substrates and runs real-kind surface proof only when declared inputs changed; it pushes nothing.
- `release-candidate.yaml` (maintainer-dispatched against a reviewed PR branch) publishes an immutable PR-scoped candidate — base + derived layers, or changed layers only — making the digest-pinned tasks available to `/calibrate` and `run-trial`.
- `promote-release.yaml` never invokes a Docker build: it runs 3 oracle + 3 nop hosted trials per named scenario, then `tools.push_images --promote-from` copies the exact candidate digests to the final `vN` tags. The promotion commit includes `.github/base-release-receipts/<substrate>.json` with the candidate source, final release, platform, base fingerprint, lock hash, workflow-run identity, artifact name, and promoted digests. A coupled release's last promotion refreshes the earlier receipts so every artifact binds to the same final PR head.
- `task-qualification.yaml` treats a changed `image_build_inputs` surface as the explicit `maintainer-substrate-release` action. For every substrate in `base_release_substrates`, trusted default-branch code validates the successful `promote-release` run and its artifact, exact PR head, candidate ancestry and allowed post-candidate paths, recomputed fingerprint/lock hash, and live registry digests. The aggregate qualification check accepts a skipped proof job only when that substrate list is empty.
- `gc-images.yaml` is the lock-rooted GHCR garbage collector (weekly cron).

## Not implemented / considered

The original doc proposed five levers for cutting the 25–40 min Daytona trial wall-clock, of which only the fan-out idea survives (realized as the Blacksmith calibration matrix above, not as a generic substrate × scenario × agent dispatch):

- **Prebaked Daytona sandbox base image** (stock upstream images pre-pulled into containerd, weekly rebuild) — not built.
- **Prebaked Frappe site** (`bench new-site` at image build time, restore at trial time) — not built.
- **Self-hosted runner with a persistent k3s cluster** for dev iteration — not built.
- **uv / docker buildx caching in workflows** (`actions/cache` on `~/.local/share/uv`, buildx cache for custom images) — not built; only the local Docker layer cache in `build.sh` applies.

Revisit any of these only if Daytona trial wall-clock becomes the bottleneck again; the calibration loop no longer runs through Daytona at all.
