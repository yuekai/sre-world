# The Frappe capture-surface gap — Redis has no state-probe plane

*(Scope note: this is about a MISSING per-tier probe plane, not a broken gate. The
config differ behaves as designed; see the Claim below before citing this doc.)*

Last updated: 2026-08-25. Companion to `docs/TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` A3 ("every decoy is
*observed* by a gate that can fail it") and `docs/AUTHORING-FRAPPE.md` §3 (minimality for a
runtime fault lives in `mariadb_state`, not the config differ).

**Claim, stated precisely.** The gap is a *missing probe plane for one tier*, not a broken
gate. Two things are true and must not be conflated:

1. **Not a defect:** on Frappe the config differ grades exactly one question — *did the
   persisted `my.cnf` change?* For an operational (runtime) repair the correct answer is
   "no", so an empty `mutated_keys` is the RIGHT verdict, not a failure. This is a deliberate
   design decision with a rationale in the code
   (`substrates/frappe/grader_hooks.py::build_config_after`: "conflating SET GLOBAL state
   with my.cnf would erase the distinction between an operational repair and a persistent
   configuration change"), a fail-closed guard against DoS-dodging, and a committed test
   pinning the identity. Dynamic state is graded on a *separate* plane by design.
2. **The actual gap:** that separate plane exists for MariaDB (`mariadb_state` probes, which
   genuinely observe every declared global and fail an over-repair) and **does not exist for
   Redis**. There is no `redis_state` peer. So a queue-tier scenario's
   `minimality.allowed_keys_by_component` list cannot bite, and its decoys are enforced by
   the outcome gate alone.

The per-scenario `minimality.capture_sources` override **cannot** close this, and declaring
one would hard-fail the episode (§4). The fix is a `redis_state` probe plane, not a change to
the differ — changing the differ would destroy the operational-vs-persistent distinction that
every runtime-tier scenario depends on.

---

## 1. What the gate is supposed to do

`verifier/oracle/evaluate.py:143` computes `mutated_keys = diff_keys(config_before,
config_after)` and `verifier/oracle/evaluate.py:174` feeds it to `_compute_minimality`, which
at `verifier/oracle/evaluate.py:448` reports `violations = [k for k in mutated_keys if k not
in allowed]`. `verifier/oracle/minimality.py:79 diff_keys()` walks the two directory trees:
YAML files contribute dotted keys, anything else contributes an opaque `file:<relpath>` entry.

So the gate can only ever fail if the two trees differ.

## 2. Why the two trees can never differ on Frappe

`substrates/frappe/loadgen_sidecar.py:1090-1113` builds both trees inside the grading pod:

```python
for _configmap, _key, relpath in grader_hooks.capture_sources(manifest):
    rendered = before_map.get(rel)          # from the STAMPED config_before.json
    before_path.write_text(rendered)
    after_path.write_text(grader_hooks.build_config_after(rendered, declare_snapshot))
```

`config_after` is derived from `rendered` — the text the *stamper* pre-rendered at generation
time — not from a live read of the cluster. And `substrates/frappe/grader_hooks.py:657-690`
is, for all config purposes, the identity:

```python
doc = yaml.safe_load(rendered_before)      # :670
... # declare_snapshot is used ONLY to raise on an unreachable service
return yaml.safe_dump(doc, ...)            # :690
```

The snapshot's `config` payloads are never merged in. This is deliberate and documented in
that docstring ("conflating SET GLOBAL state with my.cnf would erase the distinction between
an operational repair and a persistent configuration change") — but the consequence is that
`diff_keys` returns `[]` on every Frappe run, for every capture source. The repo's own test
asserts the identity: `substrates/frappe/test_grader_hooks.py:719
test_build_config_after_null_snapshot_is_identity`.

Contrast `loadgen-common/evidence_collector.py:262-340` (the slack-spine peer), which *does*
overlay the live `/admin/config` snapshot into the rendered tree. The two substrates made
different, defensible choices: slack-spine folds live state into the differ; Frappe keeps the
differ to persisted config and grades live state on dedicated probe planes. Frappe's choice is
strictly more informative *where a probe plane exists* (it distinguishes an operational repair
from a config rewrite) — and strictly less where one does not, which today means Redis.

Reproduce offline (no cluster, no image):

```bash
uv run python - <<'EOF'
import sys, json, yaml, tempfile, pathlib
sys.path.insert(0, "substrates/frappe"); sys.path.insert(0, "verifier")
import grader_hooks as gh
from oracle.minimality import diff_keys

TASK = "tasks/frappe/03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap"
before = json.load(open(f"{TASK}/environment/chart/config-before.json"))
rel = "sut/config/mariadb.yaml"
# a declare-time snapshot in which the agent flipped the DECOY knob on the queue
snap = {"services": {"frappe-admin": {"ok": True, "config": {
    "redis-queue": {"maxmemory": "512mb", "maxmemory-policy": "allkeys-lru"}}}}}
after = gh.build_config_after(before[rel], snap)
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as td:
    for side, text in (("config_before", before[rel]), ("config_after", after)):
        p = pathlib.Path(td) / side / rel; p.parent.mkdir(parents=True); p.write_text(text)
    print("diff_keys:", diff_keys(pathlib.Path(td)/"config_before",
                                  pathlib.Path(td)/"config_after"))
EOF
# -> diff_keys: []          (run 2026-08-25 against upstream/main @ 19aa628)
```

That `[]` is the same empty `mutated_keys` an independent review observed on a live golden
leg. It is structural, not a fluke of that run.

## 3. Why `minimality.capture_sources` cannot close it

`substrates/frappe/grader_hooks.py:403-437 capture_sources()` really does accept a
per-scenario override — a non-empty list of `{configmap, key, relpath}` mappings, absent →
`DEFAULT_CAPTURE_SOURCE` (`grader_hooks.py:84-88`, the MariaDB `my.cnf` at
`sut/config/mariadb.yaml`). Adding a Redis entry there is a scenario-only edit and needs no
image release. It still cannot work, for three independent reasons — any one of them is
sufficient.

**(a) The channel is inert (§2).** Whatever you capture, `config_after` is a normalisation of
`config_before`. A second capture source adds a second pair of identical files.

**(b) None of the graded knobs live in a rendered artifact that changes.** The Bitnami redis
subchart *does* render a ConfigMap. Inside the packaged
`substrates/frappe/chart/charts/erpnext/charts/redis-17.15.2.tgz`, `templates/configmap.yaml`
emits `<release>-<alias>-configuration`, gated by `redis.createConfigmap`
(`templates/_helpers.tpl:190` — true whenever `existingConfigmap` is
empty, which is our case: `substrates/frappe/chart/values.yaml:224-243` sets no
`existingConfigmap` and no `master.configuration`). So `stamp-redis-queue-configuration` with
keys `redis.conf` / `master.conf` / `replica.conf` is present in `helm template` output and
*is* capturable. It just does not contain anything the gate cares about:

* The **fault** is injected through `master.extraFlags`
  (`scenarios/frappe/03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap/spec.yaml` `fault.values.erpnext.redis-queue.
  master.extraFlags`; the Frappe fault validator allows *only* that leaf for the redis
  families — `substrates/frappe/checks/fault_validators.py:59-60`). Bitnami renders
  `extraFlags` into the **scripts** ConfigMap, not the configuration one:
  `stamp-redis-queue-scripts/start-master.sh` ends with `ARGS+=("--maxmemory")` /
  `ARGS+=("32mb")`. The configuration ConfigMap carries only the chart's static
  `appendonly yes` / `save ""` / `rename-command` lines, identical on every scenario.
* The **golden fix and the decoys** are runtime `CONFIG SET`s. Both shipped queue scenarios
  repair with `reconfigure-infra.sh redis-queue <key> <value>`
  (`scenarios/frappe/03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap/solve.sh:34`,
  `scenarios/frappe/06-queue-write-guard/solve.sh:8`), which speaks RESP `CONFIG SET` to the
  live server (`substrates/frappe/main/reconfigure-infra.sh:1-13`). Nothing on disk, in any
  ConfigMap, or in any chart value changes. Before and after would be byte-identical even if
  §2 were fixed.

**(c) A non-default capture source hard-fails the episode.**
`grader_hooks.py:760-777 render_config_before()` postprocesses only the default source
(INI → semantic YAML); for any other source it stores the raw text verbatim (`:777 text =
raw_ini`). At grade time `build_config_after` calls `yaml.safe_load` on that raw text
(`:670`) and raises unless it is a YAML *mapping*. Redis conf and shell script are neither:

```bash
uv run python - <<'EOF'
import subprocess, sys
sys.path.insert(0, "substrates/frappe")
import grader_hooks as gh
TASK = "tasks/frappe/03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap"
out = subprocess.run(["helm", "template", "stamp", f"{TASK}/environment/chart",
                      "-f", f"{TASK}/environment/task.values.yaml"],
                     capture_output=True, text=True, check=True).stdout
for cm, key in (("stamp-redis-queue-configuration", "master.conf"),
                ("stamp-redis-queue-scripts", "start-master.sh")):
    raw = gh.extract_configmap_key(out, cm, key)
    print(f"{cm}/{key}: carries maxmemory? {'maxmemory' in raw}")
    try:
        gh.build_config_after(raw, None); print("   build_config_after: OK")
    except Exception as exc:
        print(f"   build_config_after: {type(exc).__name__}")
EOF
# -> stamp-redis-queue-configuration/master.conf: carries maxmemory? False
#       build_config_after: ParserError
#    stamp-redis-queue-scripts/start-master.sh:  carries maxmemory? True
#       build_config_after: ScannerError
# (run 2026-08-25, helm v3.18.4, against upstream/main @ 19aa628)
```

That exception is raised inside `_collect_episode_evidence`, which
`substrates/frappe/loadgen_sidecar.py:1037-1050` documents as terminal: no rewards file →
`RewardFileNotFoundError` → the trial is a loud infra error. So the override is not merely
useless here; declaring it would break both scenarios.

Fixing (c) or (a) means editing `substrates/frappe/grader_hooks.py`, which
`substrates/frappe/substrate.yaml:40` lists under `image_build_inputs` — a base-image change
requiring a maintainer release (release-candidate → promote-release).

## 4. Which shipped tasks are affected, and what actually enforces them

Sweep of every scenario's `minimality.allowed_keys_by_component` against the gate that can
observe those keys (`uv run python` over `scenarios/*/*/ground-truth.yaml`, 2026-08-25):

| scenario | allow-list keys | observed by | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `frappe/03-F1-connection-cap` | `mariadb.max_connections` | `mariadb_state` probes (`allowed_mutations: [max_connections]`, plus `unrelated_globals`) | enforced, by the *other* gate |
| `frappe/03-U1-user-conn-cap` | (empty) | `mariadb_state` | enforced |
| `frappe/03-mariadb-read-only` | (empty) | `mariadb_state` | enforced |
| `frappe/00-BASE-health` | (empty) | — | vacuous by design |
| **`frappe/03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap`** | `redis-queue.maxmemory` | **nothing** | **decorative** |
| **`frappe/06-queue-write-guard`** | `redis-queue.min-replicas-to-write` | **nothing** | **decorative** |
| `slack-spine/*` | various | `evidence_collector.build_config_after` overlays live `/admin/config` | enforced |

Neither queue scenario declares `mariadb_state`, `db_state`, `lock_state`, `seq_integrity`, or
a verifier-v2 `verification:` block, so no gate observes a Redis knob at all.

**`03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap` — real enforcement.** Gate 1 outcome only, via
`thresholds.by_driver.rq_enqueue` (goodput ≥ 0.05, error rate ≤ 0.93), plus Gate 2
attribution on the report (`redis_queue` / `redis_queue.capacity` + mechanism keywords). The
scenario's entire premise — the LRU trap — is unobserved: an agent that raises `maxmemory`
*and* flips `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru` clears the OOM, passes Gate 1, files a correct
report, passes Gate 2, and `mutated_keys` is `[]`, so minimality passes too. The ground
truth's own comment (`ground-truth.yaml`, `minimality:` block) claims the flip "fails Gate 2
attribution (unrelated mutation on the queue policy)" — Gate 2 evaluates the *report text*
(`verifier/oracle/attribution.py`), never mutations, so it does not.

**`06-queue-write-guard` — real enforcement.** Gate 1 outcome via
`thresholds.by_driver.rq_enqueue` (goodput ≥ 0.5, error rate ≤ 0.5), `docker_state.services:
[svc-frappe-web]`, and Gate 2 attribution (`redis_queue` / `redis_queue.config`). Its two
documented decoys are both unobserved: loosening `min-replicas-max-lag` alongside the correct
`min-replicas-to-write 0` passes everything, and attaching a replica is a topology change no
Frappe gate inspects (`docker_state` covers `svc-frappe-web` only, and `pod_state` restart
counts do not fingerprint replica topology). `REVIEWER.md`'s "Minimality gate rejects any fix
that mutates a decoy key" is false as shipped.

**The two scenarios are not equally exposed.** The gap bites hardest where the decoy is
*functionally effective*, because then outcome-only gating does not merely fail to punish it —
it may reward it.

* `06-queue-write-guard`'s named decoy is safe by accident. Loosening
  `min-replicas-max-lag` cannot satisfy a guard that no lag setting can satisfy (zero
  replicas), so NOREPLICAS persists, `rq_enqueue` keeps 503ing, and Gate 1 fails that agent
  correctly. Outcome-only gating is *sufficient* for a decoy that cannot clear the symptom.
  The decoy that does escape on 06 is the unnamed one: **attaching a replica** clears
  NOREPLICAS, so Gate 1 passes, and no Frappe gate inspects replica topology.
* `03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap`'s decoy is the dangerous kind, and it is the scenario's whole
  point. Flipping `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru` **without** raising the cap makes redis evict
  instead of refusing, so `RPUSH` succeeds, `after_insert` does not throw, and the response
  carries `message.name` — which is exactly `RQEnqueueDriver`'s success predicate
  (`substrates/frappe/loadgen_frappe/drivers.py:449-463`: `ok = status == 200`,
  `correct = bool(message.name)`). On the driver's own terms that leg looks like a repair
  while queued jobs are being silently discarded — the data-loss outcome the trap exists to
  punish. **Unmeasured**: calibration run 31744217912 covered golden (512mb, noeviction) and
  nop (32mb, noeviction) only; the 32mb + `allkeys-lru` leg has never been run, so whether it
  actually clears `by_driver.rq_enqueue`'s bands (goodput ≥ 0.05, error rate ≤ 0.93) is a
  hypothesis from the driver predicate, not a measurement. It is cheap to settle with a
  one-leg probe and should be settled before this scenario is used to score anything.

That asymmetry is what makes option (2) below urgent rather than merely correct: a knob that
*can* clear the symptom must be observed by a probe, because the outcome gate will not
distinguish it from a real repair.

**`06-queue-lag-bait`** exists nowhere on `upstream`: absent from `scenarios/frappe/` at
`19aa628`, no match anywhere in that tree, and no match across all 577 refs from
`git ls-remote upstream` (checked 2026-08-25). Everything in §3 applies to it unchanged — it
is a queue-tier config-fault scenario on the same substrate — but it could not be annotated
here. If its decoy is one that clears the symptom, it inherits 03-QE1's exposure, not 06's.

## 5. Options, ranked by cost

1. **Accept and document (this file), and stop writing Redis keys into
   `allowed_keys_by_component`.** Zero cost, zero grading bytes. Leaves both queue scenarios
   single-gated on outcome: they still discriminate golden from nop (both are calibrated
   3/3 · 3/3), but they do not discriminate *minimal* from *over-broad* repair, which is what
   the trap was authored to test. This is the honest status quo, not a fix.
2. **A `redis_state` probe plane, modelled on `mariadb_state`.** The right fix. Split across
   the image boundary, which matters for scheduling:
   * *Collector side — image bytes.* A peer of `loadgen_sidecar.py::_capture_mariadb_state`
     that speaks `CONFIG GET` to `svc-redis-queue` / `svc-redis-cache` at baseline,
     declaration, and soak end, writing `sut/redis_state_<phase>.json`, plus a closed
     code-owned key allowlist next to `MARIADB_GLOBAL_VARIABLES` (`grader_hooks.py:91-98`).
     One base release.
   * *Oracle side — task bytes.* `verifier/oracle/redis_state.py` as a near-copy of
     `mariadb_state.py` (`mutated = {probe | baseline ≠ declaration}`,
     `unexpected = mutated − allowed_mutations`), ANDed into `overall` beside the other
     cross-link gates at `verifier/oracle/evaluate.py:233-247`. No image release; ships with
     the task's `tests/oracle/` copy.
     Then `03-QE1` declares `maxmemory` **and** `maxmemory-policy` as probes with
     `allowed_mutations: [maxmemory]`, and `06` declares `min-replicas-to-write` **and**
     `min-replicas-max-lag` with `allowed_mutations: [min-replicas-to-write]`. Both traps
     become mechanically wrong. Cost: one base release + one oracle module + re-calibration of
     both scenarios (grader fingerprint moves).
     *Caveat:* `CONFIG GET` covers knobs, not topology. 06's escaping decoy — attaching a
     replica — needs `INFO replication` (`connected_slaves`) or a StatefulSet-replica probe
     alongside the knob probes; a plane built on `CONFIG GET` alone leaves it unobserved.
3. **Make `build_config_after` merge the declare snapshot on Frappe** (the slack-spine shape),
   and teach `frappe-admin-sidecar` to report Redis `CONFIG GET` under `/admin/config`. Same
   base-release cost as (2) but strictly worse: it re-conflates runtime state with the
   rendered `my.cnf` surface, which `grader_hooks.py:660-668` deliberately separated, and it
   would start reporting every dynamic MariaDB repair as a config mutation.
4. **Chart change so the Redis knob renders into `master.configuration`, then capture that
   ConfigMap — ruled out, not merely expensive.** `substrates/frappe/chart/` is host-side and
   *not* in `image_build_inputs`, so the chart edit itself is cheap, and it would also need
   `_ALLOWED_REDIS_MASTER` widened (`checks/fault_validators.py:60`). But it does not work:
   blockers §3(a) and §3(c) are untouched, and the *repair* is still a `CONFIG SET` that
   rewrites no ConfigMap, so before/after stay identical. Do not attempt this.

**Recommendation: (1) now, (2) bundled into the next Frappe base release.** Until (2) lands,
a queue-tier scenario must not claim minimality enforcement in its `REVIEWER.md` trap map, and
A3 review of a Frappe scenario should require naming the *probe* that observes each decoy —
`allowed_keys_by_component` is not an answer on this substrate.

Independently of (2), **measure 03-QE1's decoy-alone leg** (32mb cap retained,
`maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`) against the calibrated `by_driver.rq_enqueue` bands. It is one
probe leg, it needs no code change, and it decides whether the scenario currently *rewards*
the repair it was written to punish (§4) — which is the difference between "a gate is missing"
and "a shipped task can be scored backwards".

## 6. Follow-ups to fold into whichever change re-validates these tasks

These are wrong-but-inert today; fixing any of them moves `grader_fingerprint` (ground truth
is hashed at `tools/substrate.py:715-729`) and therefore forces re-calibration, so they are
deliberately left alone here.

* `fault.file: sut/values/redis-queue.yaml` in both queue ground truths names a path that is
  never captured and never written. It is documentary only — no oracle or tool reads
  `fault.file` — but it reads as proof of a capture that does not exist. `03-QE1`'s comment
  goes further and asserts "the Phase 4 stamper renders that path"; the stamped
  `config-before.json` contains exactly one key, `sut/config/mariadb.yaml`.
* `docs/AUTHORING-FRAPPE.md:207` uses `sut/config/redis-queue.yaml` as its example capture
  path, implying such a capture exists.
* `docs/TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md:165-172` correctly says a Redis knob is not observed, but
  frames it as a coverage problem ("It only sees captured paths"). §2 above shows the deeper
  cause: on Frappe the differ sees no *change* at any path.
* Both queue ground truths' `minimality:` comments describe enforcement that does not exist
  (see §4). The prose, not the data, is the defect.
