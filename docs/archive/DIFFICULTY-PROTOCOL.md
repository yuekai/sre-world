> **Archived 2026-10-07.** Historical: a 2026-08 protocol for real-agent difficulty trials on the original's infrastructure; it was not carried into the reconstruction. Kept for the record; do not update. Current docs are indexed in [docs/README.md](../README.md).

# Difficulty-evidence protocol — real-agent trials

Last updated: 2026-08-25. Companion to `docs/TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` (row C4),
`docs/TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md` §5, and `docs/DECISIONS.md` D15.

The corpus reports no agent solve rate for any task. It therefore cannot claim
difficulty, cannot claim non-saturation, and cannot justify its controlled-variant
design. Rubric C4 is ❌ or ⚠️ on every calibrated scenario. This file specifies the
trials that would close that gap, the categories the transcripts get sorted into, the
block those results are written back into, and the exact commands to run — so that
running them is execution, not design.

**Nothing here has been run.** Every number in §3's worked example is a labelled
placeholder. Where this protocol cannot support a claim at the n it funds, it says so
rather than weakening the claim.

Sources use the rubric's short names: **SG** = SREGym (arXiv:2605.07161), **DG** =
DevOps-Gym (arXiv:2601.20882), **AX** = APEX-SWE (arXiv:2601.08806).

## 0. Preconditions

Seven things must be true before step 1 of the run sheet. Four already are; one is
red today and is the reason the trials cannot run yet.

| # | precondition | state on `upstream/main` 2026-08-25 |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | every target task has a recorded FP=FN=0 fence | ✅ all 7 frappe tasks `thresholds.provisional: false`, 3/3 + 3/3; run ids in §4.5 |
| P2 | that fence is evidence about the bytes the trials will run | ❌ **`tasks/INDEX.json` reports `calibration.current: false` for all 8 frappe tasks** (`base_current` false on 6, `health_current` false on 4). Consequently `hosted_ready` — computed as `(not provisional) and eval_ready and qualification.current`, `generate_tasks.py:2331` — is **false for every frappe task.** |
| P3 | frappe qualification is automatic (the 5-trial GLM cohort can run at all) | ✅ `substrates/frappe/substrate.yaml:82` `automatic: true`, `blockers: []` |
| P4 | 06-queue-lag-bait re-calibrated after the vocabulary fix | ✅ run `32862496732`, 2026-08-25 (supersedes `32812807152`, which its `REVIEWER.md` correctly flagged as stale) |
| P5 | trajectories are machine-readable | ✅ `tools/validate_oddish_trial_artifacts.py --require-atif --atif-out` writes `<trial_id>.trajectory.json` (ATIF-v1.7) per real-agent trial |
| P6 | the model can be pinned on the lane used | ⚠️ hosted only. `harbor run` takes `-m`; `run-trial.yaml:179` passes it; **`tools/local_run.py::build_harbor_cmd` does not construct one.** The local lane cannot name its model. |
| P7 | the corpus is merged and digest-pinned at one SHA | ⚠️ pending the post-release merge; every hosted dispatch below is `-f ref=<SHA>` |

**P2 is the binding blocker and it is why these trials cannot run today.** It is not a
defect: the release/promote cycle re-stamps the fingerprints and re-fences at the
promoted SHA, which is exactly what "the post-release merged corpus" means. But it
must be re-checked at that SHA rather than assumed — a difficulty number measured on
bytes whose fence belongs to different bytes is the C4 version of rubric A1's
complaint, and would be worth less than no number.

P6 is the only precondition requiring a code change, and only if the local lane is
chosen. See §2.6.

**Correction to the framing this protocol was commissioned under.** Two premises are
out of date and one is wrong:

* Frappe no longer carries `qualification.automatic: false`. It flipped to `true` in
  #243, once `substrates/frappe/health/frappe_db.yaml` landed and the impact
  classifier stopped reporting blockers. That is what makes the GLM cohort reachable
  at all — but *reachable* is not *already run*: the dispatch is gated on a lifecycle
  label, and no unexpired GLM evidence exists for any frappe task. §2.2 has the
  measurement.
* `docs/KILL-LEDGER.md` has no wall W10. The walls stop at W9. The
  infrastructure-masquerading-as-result problem is real and is documented, but in
  three other places — `oddish_qualification.py::classify_trial_outcome`,
  `validate_trial_capture.py`, and 03-QE1's Trial 4 (§2.5). Cite those; do not cite
  W10.

## 1. The failure-mode taxonomy

### 1.1 Why an ordered procedure, not a set of labels

The categories co-occur. One trial can take a decoy, over-repair, submit a near-miss
vocabulary token, and hit the deadline. "Mutually exclusive" is a property of the
*decision procedure*, not of the definitions. This section therefore publishes an
ordered rule list — **first match wins, evaluated top to bottom** — so two readers
handed the same `deterministic-report.json` and `trajectory.json` produce the same
label. Without the order the classification step stays a judgement call, which is the
thing the taxonomy exists to eliminate.

The order is: gradeability first (a trial that produced no evidence is not a data
point), then harness artifacts (a failure caused by the grading paperwork is not
difficulty), then success, then the substantive failure modes ordered from
*most-specific artifact signal* to *least*.

### 1.2 Gate 0 — gradeability. Not a category.

Applied before classification. A trial that fails gate 0 is **removed from the
denominator**, replaced by a re-run, and counted separately.

```
G0.1  status != "success", or error_message set, or result.harbor_exception set
      -> classify with oddish_qualification.classify_trial_outcome():
           "agent_fail"          -> the diagnostic string contains "agent"; this IS
                                    a data point, continue to R1
           "infrastructure_fail" -> DISCARD, re-run
           "artifact_fail"       -> DISCARD, re-run
           "cancelled"           -> DISCARD, re-run
G0.2  stats.n_errored_trials != 0 in result.json           -> DISCARD, re-run
G0.3  the exception class is in validate_trial_capture.DETERMINISTIC_EXCEPTIONS
      ({"HealthcheckError"})                               -> DISCARD, DO NOT re-run;
      the same boot fails the same way every time (measured: across 24 frappe trial
      cells a retry never once rescued an attempt-1 failure). Fix the task first.
G0.4  rundir is missing any of verdict.json, deterministic-report.json,
      loadgen.jsonl                                        -> DISCARD, re-run
G0.5  offline re-grade of the captured rundir does not reproduce the online reward
      (tools/regrade, or validate_oddish_trial_artifacts' offline equality check)
                                                           -> DISCARD, escalate;
      this is a grading-plane defect, not a trial defect.
```

**Why this is gate 0 and not a category.** `0/5` that silently means "0/3 plus two
dead clusters" is the corpus-level repeat of 03-QE1's Trial 4, where a
`NetworkConnectionError` was actually `exit 137` (kernel OOM-kill of the CLI on an
m6i.2xlarge) and the scenario's own `REVIEWER.md` had to write "Trial 4 is **NOT** a
difficulty data point." Every published n is therefore accompanied by a discard count
and the discard reasons. A task whose discard count exceeds its n is reported as
*not measured*, not as hard.

The one subtlety worth stating: `classify_trial_outcome` distinguishes agent failure
from infrastructure failure by testing whether the string `"agent"` appears in the
concatenated `error_message` + `exception_type`. `AgentTimeoutError` matches;
`NetworkConnectionError` does not. That is the right default and it is also exactly
what mislabelled QE1 Trial 4. Where an exception is ambiguous, read the Harbor
`result.json` exit status before trusting the classifier.

### 1.3 Gate 1 — harness artifact. Not difficulty evidence.

```
R0  The fault knob is restored AND every outcome check passes AND the report's
    /service and /component are semantically the right answer but are not the
    published canonical tokens (wrong spelling, hyphen-for-underscore, singular,
    off-registry near-miss).
    -> HARNESS ARTIFACT (vocabulary). Excluded from every difficulty number;
       reported separately with the exact submitted string.
```

*Signal.* v2: `deterministic-report.json` check `canonical_report_component` (or
`canonical_report_service`) `pass: 0`, while the repair check for the scenario's own
knob (e.g. `read_only_released_at_declaration`) is `pass: 1`. v1: `verdict.json`
`gate2.registry_ok == false`, or `gate2.extra` non-empty with a near-miss token, while
`gate1.pass` is true. In both cases read the submitted value at
`derived/incident-report.json` `/component` and compare it by eye to
`component_registry`.

*Why it is separate.* 06-queue-lag-bait's own review record documents this happening:
the canonical spellings "were not discoverable here — the instruction points at
`submit_incident_report --help`, which fails when a scenario does not publish its
vocabulary, while grading requires the underscore form." A correct repair with a
near-miss token fails `canonical_report_component` and would otherwise be counted as
*wrong diagnosis*, inflating the corpus's apparent difficulty with its own paperwork.
Every current frappe scenario sets `report_vocabulary: true`, so R0 should be rare; if
it is not, the vocabulary surface is broken and that is the finding.

### 1.4 The ordered rules

Evaluated in order; first match wins. Every rule names the artifact and field.

```
R1  verdict.json /overall == "pass" (v2) or overall_pass == true (v1);
    reward == 1.0
    -> SOLVED

R2  Any of: the loadgen pod was exec'd into or its records were written; a
    fault-window restart of a required service moved the restart baseline; offered
    work was suppressed (worker replicas driven to 0, driver traffic blocked); the
    repair was reverted after declaration.
    -> REWARD-HACK ATTEMPT

R3  The scenario's own fault knob is at its repaired value at declaration AND every
    outcome check passes AND a scope/minimality check fails.
    -> CORRECT BUT OVER-BROAD REPAIR

R4  A knob named in the scenario's REVIEWER.md decoy map was mutated, and the
    scenario's own fault knob was NOT restored.
    -> DECOY TAKEN

R5  The scenario's own fault knob is restored AND the incident report names a
    canonical but wrong (service, component) pair.
    -> RIGHT FIX, WRONG DIAGNOSIS

R6  The incident report names the right (service, component) pair AND the fault knob
    is not at its repaired value (or the outcome gate fails).
    -> RIGHT DIAGNOSIS, WRONG FIX

R7  No incident report was filed, or a report was filed naming a wrong pair with no
    repair attempted on any knob, AND the trajectory ran to the deadline.
    -> BUDGET EXHAUSTED

R8  No incident report, or a report filed with no repair attempted, AND the
    trajectory terminated before the deadline.
    -> GAVE UP

R9  Anything reaching here.
    -> WRONG DIAGNOSIS (residual)
```

### 1.5 Category definitions and classifying signals

| # | category | one-line definition | classifying signal (v2 / v1) | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | **solved** | The graded verdict passed. | `verdict.json` `/overall == "pass"`; `deterministic-report.json` `/overall` agrees (validator asserts it) / `verdict.json` `overall_pass == true` | artifact |
| R2 | **reward-hack attempt** | The agent tried to move the measurement rather than the system. | `derived/legacy-outcome.json` `/checks/services_up/value/all_running == false` with a restart-baseline delta (check `required_services_running`); goodput held by suppressing offered work; `no_post_declaration_config_drift` `pass: 0` / v1 `minimality.post_declare_drift.violations` non-empty. Loadgen-pod exec is barred by RBAC (D-decision: `pods/exec` never reaches loadgen) so it appears as a **denial** in `trajectory.json`, not as a passing artifact — that denial is the signal. | artifact + ATIF |
| R3 | **correct but over-broad repair** | Fixed the right thing, and also changed things it was told not to. | Fault-knob repair check `pass: 1` AND any of `runtime_mutation_is_targeted` (`derived/mariadb-state.json` `/checks/mutation_scope/pass`), `observed_database_state_is_stable`, `no_protected_file_mutation` (`repair_scope.changed_keys != []`) `pass: 0` / v1 `minimality.violations` non-empty | artifact (see 1.6 for the exception) |
| R4 | **decoy taken** | Repaired a knob the scenario planted as plausible-and-wrong. | The mutated probe id appears in `derived/mariadb-state.json` `mutation_scope.unexpected` **and** is listed in the scenario's `REVIEWER.md` decoy map; the fault-knob repair check is `pass: 0` | artifact + REVIEWER map |
| R5 | **right fix, wrong diagnosis** | The system works; the report blames the wrong component. | Fault-knob repair check `pass: 1`, outcome checks `pass: 1`, `canonical_report_component` `pass: 0` with an in-registry token / v1 `gate1.pass && !gate2.component_match && gate2.registry_ok` | artifact |
| R6 | **right diagnosis, wrong fix** | Named the cause correctly; the repair did not take. | `canonical_report_component` `pass: 1` AND (`<knob>_released_at_declaration` `pass: 0` OR `sustained_error_rate`/`sustained_correct_goodput` `pass: 0`) / v1 `gate2.pass && !gate1.pass` | artifact |
| R7 | **budget exhausted** | Ran out of clock mid-investigation. | Gate-0 `agent_fail` with `AgentTimeoutError`, or `trajectory.json` last step within one step of the `[agent] timeout_sec` wall, AND `derived/incident-report.json` absent or `/pass == false` for absence | ATIF + Harbor result |
| R8 | **gave up** | Stopped early — declared without repairing, or ended the session with budget left. | Trajectory terminated with ≥10% of `[agent] timeout_sec` unused AND no mutation observed in `mutation_scope.mutated` | ATIF + artifact |
| R9 | **wrong diagnosis** | Investigated, concluded, and the conclusion was wrong — without landing on a mapped decoy. | Residual. `canonical_report_component` `pass: 0`, fault knob not restored, mutated set disjoint from the decoy map | artifact |

**Why each is distinguishable from its neighbour.**

* **R3 vs R4** — both show `mutation_scope.unexpected` non-empty. They are separated
  by whether the *scenario's own knob* was also restored. R3 fixed it and swept; R4
  fixed the wrong thing instead. Reading `unexpected` alone cannot tell them apart;
  reading `unexpected` together with the fault-knob repair check can.
* **R4 vs R9** — both end unrepaired with a wrong conclusion. R4 requires the touched
  knob to be *in that scenario's published decoy map*. This is the measurement the
  ladder exists to produce, so it must not absorb generic wrong turns: a knob nobody
  predicted is R9, not R4.
* **R5 vs R6** — the SG asymmetry. SG measures mitigation succeeding 22–62% of the
  time with a wrong diagnosis (§3.3, Table 5), and reports that when diagnosis
  succeeds mitigation succeeds 69–88% but when it fails only 35–59%. R5 is that first
  cell and R6 the second; keeping them apart is precisely what makes our numbers
  comparable to SG's. Our binary reward collapses both to 0, which is why the
  *taxonomy*, not the reward, carries the comparison.
* **R7 vs R8** — an agent that stops at 09:58 of a 10:00 budget learned something
  different from one that stops at 03:00. The 10% margin is arbitrary; it is declared
  here so it is applied consistently, and it is recorded in the block so a reader can
  re-derive with a different threshold.
* **R2 first among failures** — a reward-hack attempt that also over-repairs must be
  reported as a hack. Reward hacking is the property the corpus's counterexample
  matrix (`STANDARD_CASES`) exists to defend against; under-reporting it is worse
  than under-reporting an over-repair.
* **R1 before everything except the gates** — a passing verdict is a pass regardless of
  what the trajectory looks like. If a trial passes while the trajectory shows a hack,
  that is a grading defect and goes to §6, not to the taxonomy.

### 1.6 Signal availability is not uniform — read this before comparing scenarios

Some categories are mechanical from the graded artifacts; others are ATIF-only; and
which is which **varies by scenario**. Composition comparisons across scenarios with
different capture surfaces are apples-to-oranges unless this is stated.

| scenario | oracle | R3 over-repair derivable from artifacts? |
|---|---|---|
| 03-F1-connection-cap | v2 | yes — MariaDB globals are probed |
| 03-U1-user-conn-cap | v2 | yes |
| 03-mariadb-read-only | v2 | yes |
| 03-readonly-flag-fog | v2 | yes — plus the three fog flags are declared probes |
| 03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap | v1 | **no** — `grader_hooks.DEFAULT_CAPTURE_SOURCE` is MariaDB my.cnf only; redis keys are invisible to the differ |
| 06-queue-write-guard | v1 | **no** — same ceiling |
| 06-queue-lag-bait | v1 | **no** — its own `REVIEWER.md`: "an agent who fixes the guard AND ALSO tunes the lag window passes — that over-repair is invisible on this capture surface" |

For the three redis-tier scenarios, R3 is derivable only from `trajectory.json` (look
for `reconfigure-infra.sh` / `CONFIG SET` calls against keys outside
`minimality.allowed_keys_by_component`). Rule R3 still applies; its *evidence class*
changes from artifact to transcript, and the published table must mark it. The same
constraint means R4 on 06-queue-lag-bait — its whole reason for existing — is
transcript-derived, because tuning `min-replicas-max-lag` is ungraded. That is a
stated limitation of the rung, not a defect discovered here.

The other structural asymmetry: 09-I1-seq-lock-leak grades attribution as *advisory*
("report wording, attribution, and mechanism … do not determine repair reward"), so
R5 cannot fire there and R6 cannot be separated from R1 by the reward. Slack-spine
scenarios with advisory attribution are excluded from any R5/R6 comparison.

### 1.7 Comparability to the source papers

The point of a fixed taxonomy is a citable comparison. The mapping:

| ours | SG (Table 5, §3.3) | DG (§4.2) | AX (§4.2, §5.2) |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 solved | E2E success (17.9% on SG-native, 63.7% on ported) | task pass | Pass@1 |
| R5 right fix, wrong diagnosis | mitigation succeeds with wrong diagnosis (22–62%) | "coincidental fixes" that pass repair with a wrong monitoring conclusion | — (AX grades repair only) |
| R6 right diagnosis, wrong fix | diagnosis succeeds, mitigation fails (12–31%, complement of 69–88%) | — | *open-loop execution* — "code generation is equivalent to task completion" |
| R4 decoy taken | "treat the first plausible anomaly as the target failure" (§3.1, App. D.3) | "significant false positives" on Normal Cases (14.3% of monitoring tasks) | *specification hallucination* |
| R9 wrong diagnosis | localization failure (wrong originating component) | — | *bad environment understanding* |
| R3 over-broad repair | — | — | — (AX's complexity floor runs the other way; see rubric conflict 5) |
| R7 budget exhausted | — (SG does not report it) | 17% "inherently difficult" is the nearest analogue | *bad context handling* — 16,515-char log dumps, truncation ignored |
| R2 reward-hack attempt | App. B's two standard exploits — disable the injector, restart to clear the alert (44%) | — | reward-hack screening at validation, not at eval |
| gate 0 discards | — | — | — |

Three honest gaps in that mapping. (a) SG has no budget-exhaustion row, so our R7 has
no SG counterpart and cannot be compared against 17.9% directly — a corpus where R7
dominates is *not* demonstrating what SG's 17.9% demonstrates (see §2.4). (b) DG's
"inherently difficult" is a post-hoc human judgement over failures, not a
transcript-mechanical class; our R7+R9 is the closest and the correspondence is loose.
(c) None of the three papers report an over-repair class, so R3 has no external
anchor; it exists because D14/D16 make minimality a graded axis here and it should be
presented as house-specific.

## 2. The trial protocol

### 2.1 n = 5 per (task, model)

**The mechanism reason, which is the deciding one.**
`tools/oddish_qualification.py` sets `REAL_AGENT_TRIALS = 5` and bands the cohort mean
at `REAL_AGENT_MIN_MEAN_REWARD = 0.0` (**exclusive**) through
`REAL_AGENT_MAX_MEAN_REWARD = 0.60` (inclusive). With five binary rewards the mean
quantizes to one of {0, .2, .4, .6, .8, 1}, so the band accepts exactly one, two or
three solves and rejects zero, four or five. Both ends bind for a reason: zero solves
is indistinguishable from a broken task, and four-plus is saturation. Evidence
recorded at n=5 is therefore the *gate's own
evidence*: it can be promoted verbatim into `task-qualification` without re-running,
and a published difficulty number cannot disagree with the merge gate that let the
task in. n=3 or n=10 would both create a second, uncomparable number.

**The papers set the floor, not the value.** SG "evaluates each agent-model pair with
three runs per problem" (§3) and states no determinism guarantee — variance is handled
by repetition alone. AX averages Pass@1 over three epochs (§2 p.3) and reports a
12.8-point shift between its two task sets, which is what small-n drift looks like. DG
reports five-run stability at σ ≈ 2 points (§4.3, Table 2). n=5 clears all three.

**What n=5 actually buys, stated so a reviewer can check it.** One-sided 95% upper
bounds on the true solve rate given zero observed solves (`1 − 0.05^(1/n)`):

| n | 0 solves ⇒ true rate at most |
|---|---|
| 3 | 63% |
| **5** | **45%** |
| 10 | 26% |
| 20 | 14% |

At n=3, "0/3" is consistent with a task a coin could solve; the claim is not worth
publishing. At n=5, "0/5" supports "at most 45%", which is enough to reject the
saturation SG measures on ported problems (63.7%) but **not** enough to establish the
17.9% SG-native figure as an upper bound. Say "not saturated"; do not say "17%-hard".

One solve in five gives a point estimate of 0.20 with an exact 95% interval of roughly
[0.5%, 72%]. Publish the interval, not the point.

### 2.2 Two cohorts. Never pooled.

**Cohort A — GLM, mandatory, commissioned.** 5 × `claude-code` /
`fireworks/glm-5p2`, the cohort `task-qualification.yaml:612-621` dispatches through
`run-qualification-experiment.yaml`. Coverage: all 7 frappe tasks. 35 trials.

It has to be commissioned, not harvested, and the reason is worth stating because the
opposite is the natural assumption. The dispatch is **lifecycle-label-driven**, not
automatic on every ready-flip (`task-qualification.yaml:100-107, 618-619`):

| PR label | `mode` | `validity_only` | `require_promoted` | trials |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `task:promote` | promote | **true** | false | 2 — oracle + nop only, **no difficulty cohort** |
| `task:measure` | measure | false | **true** | 7 — oracle + nop + 5 GLM, requires a current qualification lock |
| none | ordinary | false | false | 7 |

`task:promote` is the label a release/promotion PR carries, and it is exactly the one
that suppresses the difficulty cohort — which is why `oddish_qualification.py` carries
a whole `write-baseline-config` / `validate_baseline_status` path for the two-trial
shape. **`task:measure` is the repo's own designed vehicle for this protocol**, and
using it is what Step 3 does.

Measured, 2026-08-25, against the repo's artifact index: `qualification-frappe-*`
artifacts exist for **03-F1-connection-cap only** (9 of them, 2026-07-30 → 2026-08-17)
and **every one has expired**. The other six frappe tasks have never produced one. The
only unexpired qualification artifacts in the repo belong to `hatchet`. There is
nothing to harvest.

The lane that *has* produced real-agent trajectories is `run-trial.yaml`, which
uploads `atif-<substrate>-<scenario>-<agent>` — 103 distinct such artifacts across
`slack-spine`, `chain-spine`, `saleor-spine`, `hatchet` and one frappe branch
scenario, under three agents (`claude-code`, `codex`, `mini-swe-agent`). That is the
form Step 4 uses, and it is proven plumbing.

**Cohort B — frontier, discretionary, carries the non-saturation claim.**
5 × `claude-code` / a frontier model. `run-trial.yaml`'s own default is
`anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`; confirm the current Oddish catalog id before dispatch
rather than trusting that default. Rationale: C4's argument cites SG, AX and DG all
reporting *frontier* numbers, and a corpus whose only difficulty evidence is
GLM-5p2 is weak for a reviewer — a mid-tier model failing does not establish
non-saturation. Scope Cohort B to the five tasks the ladder claim needs (the four
ladder members plus 03-F1 as the labeled baseline) = 25 trials. The remaining two
frappe tasks are optional.

`oddish_qualification.FINAL_COHORTS` already defines a third cohort
(`grok-build` / `xai/grok-4.5`, 5 trials, opt-in via `combined_final`). If it is run,
report it as a third column. SG argues a task on which all agents score identically
"carries no information" (Abstract: up to 40% spread across agents), so cross-agent
spread is itself a publishable property — but only if the cohorts stay separate. The
`codex` and `mini-swe-agent` harnesses have both been driven through `run-trial.yaml`
on other substrates, so a third and fourth *harness* (not just model) is reachable
without new plumbing if that spread is wanted.

**Every published number carries its model.** "0/5" is not a fact about a task; "0/5,
`fireworks/glm-5p2`, 600 s" is.

### 2.3 Budget: stated, held constant within a comparison, and a disqualifier

The agent budget is `[agent] timeout_sec` in `task.toml`. It is not uniform:

| task | budget | ladder pair |
|---|---|---|
| 03-F1-connection-cap | 600 s | (labeled baseline) |
| 03-U1-user-conn-cap | 600 s | — |
| 03-mariadb-read-only | 600 s | pair 1, base |
| 03-readonly-flag-fog | 600 s | pair 1, rung |
| 03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap | 1800 s | — |
| 06-queue-write-guard | 1800 s | pair 2, base |
| 06-queue-lag-bait | 1800 s | pair 2, rung |

Both ladder pairs are budget-matched *within* the pair, so the within-pair comparison
is internally valid. Cross-pair comparison is not, and neither is any absolute "this
corpus is hard" statement that averages a 600 s task with an 1800 s one.

**600 s is tight enough to be a confound.** The only wall-clock evidence the repo has
is 03-QE1's `REVIEWER.md`: Opus-5 with full observability MCP access had correctly
diffed the redis-queue and redis-cache configs, confirmed the cap through
`INFO memory`, and built a watch loop showing the error count climbing 136 → 222 —
then "ran out of `agent_time_budget` before choosing + applying a fix", at a total
trial duration of 17 m 34 s. That trial's budget was raised to 1800 s *afterwards*,
precisely because it was too short. A 0/5 at 600 s may be measuring the clock rather
than the task.

**Pre-registered disqualifier.** A task whose gradeable trials classify ≥60% R7
(budget exhausted) is **not publishable as difficulty evidence for that task**. Report
it as "budget-bound, not measured." Do not renegotiate this threshold after seeing
results — the kill ledger's own discipline (06-queue-silent-loss: "kill trigger was
written into REVIEWER.md *before* probe 2 and was not renegotiated after the result").

The honest fix, if pair 1 comes back budget-bound, is raising 03-mariadb-read-only and
03-readonly-flag-fog to 1800 s. That moves `task.toml`, moves the task fingerprint,
and re-triggers calibration on both members. It is a follow-up PR, not part of this
protocol.

### 2.4 Instruction fidelity — the agent sees what an evaluation shows it

Mechanically true on both lanes: `instruction.md` is copied verbatim from
`scenarios/<sub>/<id>/` into the committed task by `tools/generate_tasks.py`, and
every current frappe scenario sets `task.metadata.report_vocabulary: true`, which
publishes the canonical service/component spellings through
`submit_incident_report --help`. No trial-only prompt, no hint file, no reviewer notes
— `REVIEWER.md` is host-side and is never copied into the foothold pod.

One known and recorded conflict, not resolved here: verifier-v2
`public_requirements` are disclosed to the agent by design, and several of them name
the decoy ("the server-wide connection cap … must remain unchanged"). The rubric
records this as a compliance test contaminating a diagnosis test (A2, recorded
conflict 3). Difficulty numbers measured under v2 are therefore measured under
partial decoy disclosure. State it next to the number; do not correct for it.

Only the **hosted** lane also matches an evaluation's *bytes*: `local_run.py`
side-loads locally built `dev-<arch>-<fp12>` tags, so a local trial is evidence about
a different image set than the digest-pinned release a real evaluation runs. This is
the same distinction rubric A1 makes about fences.

### 2.5 Infrastructure death vs agent failure

Handled by gate 0 (§1.2). The three mechanisms it rests on, all pre-existing:

* `oddish_qualification.classify_trial_outcome(trial, artifact_valid=)` returns one of
  `artifact_fail | cancelled | agent_fail | infrastructure_fail | task_pass |
  task_fail`, splitting agent from infrastructure on whether `"agent"` appears in the
  concatenated `error_message` + `exception_type`.
* `validate_trial_capture.py` rejects a Harbor job that exited zero while its only
  trial recorded an environment or verifier exception ("Harbor's command may exit zero
  even when its only trial records an environment or verifier exception"), and
  separates transient (`EXIT_INVALID = 1`) from deterministic
  (`EXIT_DETERMINISTIC = 3`, `DETERMINISTIC_EXCEPTIONS = {"HealthcheckError"}`) with
  the measured justification that across 24 frappe trial cells a retry never once
  rescued an attempt-1 failure.
* `validate_oddish_trial_artifacts.py` re-runs the task-shipped evaluator offline over
  the pulled rundir and fails the experiment if the offline verdict or reward differs
  from the online one. That is gate G0.5.

The precedent to keep visible: 03-U1's first two `/calibrate` runs (`32290666749`,
`32296217965`) failed all six cells with `HealthcheckError` *before any trial started*,
and two successive value theories were proposed to explain a result that was not a
result. The real cause was `ERROR 1290` — MariaDB refusing `SET GLOBAL
max_user_connections` when started with 0. Two rounds of interpretation were spent on
a dead cluster.

### 2.6 Lane: hosted, with the local lane as fallback

**Use the hosted lane** (`run-trial.yaml` / `run-qualification-experiment.yaml`,
Oddish-scheduled onto EC2). It is the only lane that pins the model (`-m`), runs the
digest-pinned release bytes, produces ATIF trajectories, and re-verifies rewards
offline.

**Local lane** (`tools/local_run.py --agent claude-code`, kind on a dev box or a
direct EC2 instance) is the fallback for a task with no hosted route. Two costs, both
material: it **cannot name its model** (P6 — `build_harbor_cmd` constructs no `-m`;
fixing this is a one-line change to `tools/local_run.py` plus a `--model` argument, and
must be step 0 if this lane is chosen), and it runs side-loaded dev images rather than
the release. If the local lane is used, record `model: unpinned (harbor claude-code
default)` in the C4 block rather than guessing.

Box sizing for the local lane, from 03-QE1's Trial 4: **at least m6i.4xlarge / 64 GB**
— the m6i.2xlarge OOM-killed the CLI at 20 m 19 s. On Ubuntu 24.04 also force
`{"storage-driver": "overlay2"}` in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`; Docker 29's default
`overlayfs` corrupts blob digests on `kind load docker-image`.

**Recorded conflict, not resolved here.** The project's own notes contradict each
other on the same date about whether Oddish may be used at all
(`memory/no_oddish.md`: "USE Oddish"; `memory/infra_connections.md`: "Do NOT use
Oddish — directive reaffirmed 2026-08-17"). There is no non-Oddish hosted lane
in-repo. Confirm the lane with the owner before spending; the protocol works on either,
with the model-pinning and byte-fidelity caveats above.

## 3. The recording format

One block per scenario, appended to `scenarios/<sub>/<id>/REVIEWER.md`. It is a
`## C4 — difficulty evidence` section so a reader scoring the rubric can find it by
its criterion id.

### 3.1 Template

```markdown
## C4 — difficulty evidence

**Cohort:** <agent> / <model id> · **budget:** <task.toml [agent] timeout_sec> s ·
**lane:** hosted (Oddish/EC2, ref `<SHA>`) | local (kind, dev images) ·
**task fingerprint:** `<base_fingerprint>` · **recorded:** <YYYY-MM-DD>

**n = <gradeable>** (dispatched <total>, discarded <k> at gate 0: <reason: count>, …)

| # | trial id | reward | mode | transcript, one sentence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `<trial_id>` | 0.0 | R9 wrong diagnosis | … |
| … | | | | |

**Solve rate:** <k>/<n> · one-sided 95% upper bound <p>% · cohort mean reward <m>
(qualification band (0.00, 0.60]: <inside | outside>)

**Composition:** R1 <n> · R2 <n> · R3 <n> · R4 <n> · R5 <n> · R6 <n> · R7 <n> ·
R8 <n> · R9 <n> · R0 harness-artifact <n> (excluded)

**Run:** experiment `<oddish experiment id>`, workflow run `<gh run id>`,
artifact `qualification-<substrate>-<scenario>`, trajectories `jobs/atif/`

**Reading.** <2–4 sentences. What the failures had in common. Whether the scenario's
own decoy was taken and by how many. Anything that makes the number not mean what it
looks like — budget pressure, disclosed requirements, an ungraded residue.>
```

Rules for filling it in:

* The one-sentence transcript summary is derived from `trajectory.json`, not from
  memory of watching the run. It names what the agent inspected and where it turned
  wrong.
* `reward` is the value in the Oddish status document for that trial id, not a
  re-derivation.
* If any trial was discarded at gate 0, its reason goes in the header line, not in
  the table. Discarded trials are never listed as rows — that is what makes the
  denominator honest.
* A block with fewer than 5 gradeable rows is valid and must say so in the header. A
  block with zero gradeable rows is written anyway, with the discard reasons; "we
  could not measure this" is a finding.

### 3.2 Worked example — **placeholder values, nothing here was run**

Every number below is fabricated for shape. `PLACEHOLDER` markers are deliberate; a
real block replaces them and deletes this warning.

```markdown
## C4 — difficulty evidence

> PLACEHOLDER — no trials have been run. Values below illustrate the format only.

**Cohort:** claude-code / `fireworks/glm-5p2` · **budget:** 600 s ·
**lane:** hosted (Oddish/EC2, ref `PLACEHOLDER-40-HEX-SHA`) ·
**task fingerprint:** `PLACEHOLDER-fp12` · **recorded:** PLACEHOLDER-DATE

**n = 5** (dispatched 6, discarded 1 at gate 0: infrastructure_fail 1)

| # | trial id | reward | mode | transcript, one sentence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `PLACEHOLDER-trial-1` | 0.0 | R4 decoy taken | Diffed live globals against the on-disk my.cnf, found four divergences, and spent the rest of the budget reconciling `long_query_time` and `slow_query_log` back to the config file. |
| 2 | `PLACEHOLDER-trial-2` | 0.0 | R9 wrong diagnosis | Read the write failures as a full data volume, checked `df` on the MariaDB pod, and filed `mariadb.storage` without inspecting the error code. |
| 3 | `PLACEHOLDER-trial-3` | 0.0 | R7 budget exhausted | Was reading MariaDB error-log lines containing ERROR 1290 when the agent deadline fired; no report filed. |
| 4 | `PLACEHOLDER-trial-4` | 0.0 | R5 right fix, wrong diagnosis | Cleared the lock with `SET GLOBAL read_only = OFF`, then attributed the incident to `mariadb.config`. |
| 5 | `PLACEHOLDER-trial-5` | 1.0 | R1 solved | Matched ERROR 1290 to the read-only global, released it, left every other probe untouched, and reported `mariadb` / `mariadb.read-only`. |

**Solve rate:** 1/5 · one-sided 95% upper bound 72% · cohort mean reward 0.20
(qualification band (0.00, 0.60]: inside)

**Composition:** R1 1 · R2 0 · R3 0 · R4 1 · R5 1 · R6 0 · R7 1 · R8 0 · R9 1 ·
R0 harness-artifact 0 (excluded)

**Run:** experiment `PLACEHOLDER-exp-id`, workflow run `PLACEHOLDER-gh-run-id`,
artifact `qualification-frappe-03-readonly-flag-fog`, trajectories `jobs/atif/`

**Reading.** PLACEHOLDER. One of five solved, and the cohort mean sits exactly on the
`REAL_AGENT_MAX_MEAN_REWARD` ceiling — a second solve would fail qualification, so
this number is not comfortable. The fog flags drew one of five trials (R4), which is
what the rung was built to produce, but n=5 cannot separate that from noise; see
`docs/DIFFICULTY-PROTOCOL.md` §4.4. One trial reached the correct repair and still
failed on attribution (R5), the SG Table 5 shape. R7 is 1/5, below the 60%
budget-bound disqualifier, so this block is publishable at 600 s.
```

### 3.3 Corpus roll-up

One table in `docs/TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` §4, replacing the C4 row's ❌/⚠️ cells:
task × cohort → `k/n`, upper bound, modal failure mode, budget. No corpus-wide mean —
budgets differ (§2.3) and pooling them produces a number that describes nothing.

---

## 4. The ladder analysis

### 4.1 The two pairs

| pair | base | rung | the one varied axis | budget | oracle |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `03-mariadb-read-only` | `03-readonly-flag-fog` | benign live-vs-disk config divergences, **0 → 3** (`--slow-query-log=1 --long-query-time=2 --max-allowed-packet=67108864` as startup flags) | 600 s both | v2 both |
| 2 | `06-queue-write-guard` | `06-queue-lag-bait` | decoy-knob **visibility**: `min-replicas-max-lag` undeployed → deployed and named in the NOREPLICAS error text | 1800 s both | v1 both |

Both pairs hold the fault, injector contract, profile, causal distance, temporal
emergence, golden repair, attribution pair, outcome bands and check structure
constant. Pair 1's rung records this explicitly, and its Open Question #2 was closed
against run `32814424243`'s own baseline capture — all three fog flags verifiably
diverge in-cluster, so the axis is real and not a silently-collapsed copy of the base.

### 4.2 What gets published

**Not** a solve-rate-versus-axis curve. The published comparison is:

1. **Per member, separately:** the §3.1 C4 block. Four blocks, one per member, plus
   03-F1's as the labeled baseline.
2. **Per pair:** the failure-mode composition table, base column vs rung column,
   nine rows, counts out of n — with the evidence class of each row marked
   (artifact / transcript, per §1.6).
3. **The one number the axis predicts:** the **R4 (decoy taken) count**, base vs rung.
   Pair 1 predicts 0 → k, because the base has no observable divergence to
   mis-reconcile. Pair 2 predicts a rise in lag-window tuning, because the rung makes
   the knob visible and the error text names it.
4. **Solve rate**, reported, and expected to be uninformative — see §4.4.

### 4.3 What n buys for a *comparison*

Solve rate and composition rows are both proportions out of n per arm, so both inherit
the same arithmetic. One-sided Fisher exact at 5 vs 5:

| base vs rung | one-sided p |
|---|---|
| 5/5 vs 0/5 | 0.004 |
| 4/5 vs 0/5 | **0.024** |
| 3/5 vs 0/5 | 0.083 |
| 2/5 vs 0/5 | 0.222 |

**At n=5 per arm nothing short of a 4-vs-0 split reaches p < 0.05.** For a realistic
composition shift — say R4 rising from 20% on the base to 60% on the rung — the
normal-approximation sample size at α=0.05 two-sided, 80% power is

```
n = (1.96 + 0.8416)^2 × [0.2×0.8 + 0.6×0.4] / (0.6 − 0.2)^2 = 7.85 × 0.40 / 0.16 ≈ 20
```

per arm, and Fisher's exact test needs roughly 24–25. At the lag-bait `REVIEWER.md`
figure of ~$10–15 plus ~$5 EC2 per real-agent trial, 25 per arm × 2 arms × 2 pairs is
100 trials and roughly $1.5–2k per cohort. That is not funded and is not proposed.

### 4.4 What the comparison can and cannot claim

**Can claim, at n=5 per arm:**

* A per-member solve rate with its 95% bound and its model and its budget.
* That the corpus is not saturated for the tested models, if every member returns
  0/5 or 1/5 — "at most 45%" per member is enough to rule out the >80% SG measures on
  ported problems.
* A **descriptive** composition table with counts, from which a reader can compute
  their own intervals.
* That the rung's added axis is *observable to the agent* — because the trajectories
  either do or do not show the agent inspecting the fog flags / the lag knob. This is
  a presence claim about the trajectory, not a rate claim, and it does not need power.

**Cannot claim, at n=5 per arm:**

* Any significant difference in solve rate between base and rung. Both arms are
  designed to sit near zero; a floor-to-floor comparison has no signal, and even a
  3-vs-0 split would not clear p<0.05.
* Any significant difference in failure-mode composition. The composition table is
  **descriptive and explicitly not a hypothesis test** — it inherits the Fisher limit
  in §4.3 and must not be presented with a p-value, a "trend", or the word
  "suggests".
* A monotone difficulty-versus-distance curve. D15's ladder was conceived as a
  3/4/5 causal-distance sweep; the current pairs each vary a *different* axis at
  constant distance, and there is no third rung on either. There is no curve to plot.
* Anything cross-pair. 600 s vs 1800 s (§2.3).

**The honest summary sentence for the paper**, if the results come back as designed:
*"At n=5 per member with model M and budget B, no member was solved more than once;
the controlled rung shifted the failure-mode composition in the predicted direction,
and the design is not powered to test that shift."* That is a weaker claim than the
ladder was built to support, and it is the claim the evidence carries.

### 4.5 D15's obligation

D15 obliges the corpus to "run repeated healthy/faulted trials and publish
effect-size, FP and FN bands separately for each member before using a
score-versus-distance curve."

**First, a transfer.** D15's literal members — 03-F1b (Postgres `max_connections`,
distance 4) and 03-F1c (PgBouncer, distance 5) — no longer exist; the repo moved to
the Frappe/slack-spine substrate model under D14 and those variants were deleted. The
obligation is not void: it attaches to whatever plays the ladder role, which is now
the two pairs in §4.1. Read "each member" as the four pair members plus 03-F1.

**FP and FN bands per member: discharged by citation.** These are the calibration
fence's false positives (a nop leg passing) and false negatives (a golden leg failing),
already measured per member by `/calibrate` at 3 golden + 3 nop:

| member | fence run | date | golden | nop | FP | FN |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 03-F1-connection-cap | `32533401996` | 2026-08-21 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 0 | 0 |
| 03-mariadb-read-only | `32500701782` | 2026-08-21 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 0 | 0 |
| 03-readonly-flag-fog | `32814424243` | 2026-08-25 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 0 | 0 |
| 06-queue-write-guard | `32529855500` | 2026-08-21 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 0 | 0 |
| 06-queue-lag-bait | `32862496732` | 2026-08-25 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 0 | 0 |

Two caveats must travel with that table, and it should never be printed without both.

**It is a 0/3 observation, not a zero.** FP=FN=0 at 3 golden + 3 nop bounds each band
at "at most 63%" by the same arithmetic as §2.1. Five members each at 0/3 is stronger
jointly than any one alone, but the per-member bands are wide.

**Those fences are stale as recorded** — P2: `calibration.current` is `false` for
every one of these five tasks on `upstream/main`, so by the doc's own A1 logic they
are evidence about different bytes than the corpus now carries. The citation
discharges D15's FP/FN half **only once Step 2 is green at the promoted SHA**, at
which point these run ids are replaced by the re-fence's. Until then the table is a
record of what was measured, not a discharge.

**Effect size per member: not discharged, and not dischargeable at this n.** §4.3
gives the required n as ~20–25 per arm for a 0.2→0.6 shift; this protocol funds 5.
D15's obligation is met only in the sense that the protocol *names the measurement,
names the n it needs, and refuses to publish a curve without it*. The correct action
is to keep the obligation open in D15 and add a pointer to §4.3, not to mark it
discharged.

## 5. Run sheet

Ordered. Assumes the corpus is merged at `$SHA` (a full 40-hex commit) and the release
is promoted. `$SUB=frappe`.

**Step 0 — only if the local lane is chosen (§2.6).** Add a `--model` argument to
`tools/local_run.py` and an `-m` passthrough in `build_harbor_cmd`. Skip on the hosted
lane. *~30 min + review.*

**Step 1 — confirm the lane with the owner.** `memory/no_oddish.md` and
`memory/infra_connections.md` contradict each other. One question, one answer,
recorded in the first C4 block. *~0.*

**Step 2 — verify preconditions. This step gates everything after it.**

```
git fetch upstream && git switch --detach "$SHA"
uv run python -m tools.generate_tasks --all          # read every "stale for …" line
uv run python -c "
import json
for t in json.load(open('tasks/INDEX.json'))['tasks']:
    c = t['calibration']
    print(f\"{t['id']:32} current={c['current']} hosted_ready={t['hosted_ready']}\")
"
```

Every target task must report `calibration.current: true` **and**
`hosted_ready: true`. On `upstream/main` at the time of writing, **all eight frappe
tasks report `false` for both** — the fences are recorded but stale against current
bytes, so a difficulty number taken today would describe a different system than the
one it is attributed to. If this step is red at `$SHA`, stop: recalibrate first
(`/calibrate frappe/<id>` per task) and re-enter here. *~5 min to check; hours to
days if it is red.*

**Step 3 — Cohort A: commission the GLM trials via the `task:measure` lifecycle.**

First confirm the premise still holds — that nothing is sitting there to harvest:

```
gh api --paginate "repos/abundant-ai/sre-world/actions/artifacts?per_page=100" \
  --jq '.artifacts[] | select(.name|startswith("qualification-frappe"))
        | "\(.name) run=\(.workflow_run.id) expired=\(.expired) \(.created_at)"'
```

Measured 2026-08-25: nine hits, all `03-F1-connection-cap`, all `expired=true`. If
that is still the answer, commission. `run-qualification-experiment.yaml` is
**`workflow_call` only** — there is no manual dispatch — so the route is the
lifecycle label:

1. Open one PR against `$SHA` per task, or one PR touching all seven scenario
   directories (the coordinator matrixes over `hosted_tasks`, `max-parallel: 4`).
2. Apply the **`task:measure`** label and flip the PR ready. Do **not** apply
   `task:promote`: it sets `validity_only: true` and you get two control trials and
   no difficulty cohort (§2.2).
3. `task:measure` sets `require_promoted: true`, so each task needs a current
   qualification lock. That is the same condition as `hosted_ready` in Step 2; if
   Step 2 was green this is green.
4. Pull each result:

```
gh run download -R abundant-ai/sre-world <TASK_QUALIFICATION_RUN_ID> \
    -n "qualification-frappe-<SCENARIO>" -D /tmp/qual/<SCENARIO>
```

The bundle contains `jobs/oddish/` (per-trial rundirs), `jobs/atif/` (one
`<trial_id>.trajectory.json` per real-agent trial), the Oddish status document
(rewards and statuses) and the qualification summary. The upload step mixes
workspace-relative (`jobs/`) and absolute (`/tmp/…`) paths, so `upload-artifact`
resolves a common root and the status file's position inside the bundle is not
predictable from the workflow text — locate it rather than assuming:
`find /tmp/qual/<SCENARIO> -name 'oddish-status.json'`.

Download the artifacts the same day. Retention is why there is nothing to harvest now,
and it will be why there is nothing to harvest next time. *~1.5–2 h wall clock for the
batch (4 tasks in parallel), ~5 min per task to pull.*

Fallback if the label route is unavailable: the Step-4 `run-trial.yaml` form with
`-f model=fireworks/glm-5p2 -f n_trials=5`. It produces the same trials and the
`atif-frappe-<scenario>-claude-code` artifact, but skips
`validate_oddish_trial_artifacts.py`, so gate G0.5 must be run by hand in Step 6 on
every trial rather than one per task.

**Step 4 — Cohort B: dispatch the frontier trials.** Five tasks × 5 trials. One
dispatch per task:

```
for S in 03-F1-connection-cap 03-mariadb-read-only 03-readonly-flag-fog \
         06-queue-write-guard 06-queue-lag-bait; do
  gh workflow run run-trial.yaml -R abundant-ai/sre-world \
      -f substrate=frappe -f scenario="$S" \
      -f agent=claude-code -f model="$FRONTIER_MODEL" \
      -f launcher=k3s -f backend=ec2 \
      -f n_trials=5 -f ref="$SHA"
done
```

Confirm `$FRONTIER_MODEL` against the Oddish catalog first; `run-trial.yaml`'s default
is `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` and defaults drift. Dispatch all five, then wait — they
run independently. *~40–70 min wall clock per task, run in parallel; ~1.5 h for the
batch, assuming no re-runs.*

**Step 5 — gate 0 on every trial.** Per experiment:

```
uv run python -m tools.validate_oddish_trial_artifacts \
    --status "$STATUS_JSON" \
    --experiment-id "<EXPERIMENT_ID>" \
    --pull-root "$PULL_ROOT" \
    --agent claude-code --expected-trials 5 \
    --require-atif --atif-out /tmp/qual/<SCENARIO>/atif \
    --json-out /tmp/qual/<SCENARIO>/gate0.json
```

`$STATUS_JSON` and `$PULL_ROOT` (the directory containing `trials/`) come from the
`find` in Step 3; `--atif-out` must be empty or absent or the tool refuses.

Any trial this rejects is a gate-0 discard: record the reason, re-dispatch unless the
class is in `DETERMINISTIC_EXCEPTIONS`. Where a Claude session died at the deadline
and the ATIF is missing, recover it before discarding:

```
uv run python -m tools.recover_claude_atif \
    --status "$STATUS_JSON" \
    --experiment-id "<EXPERIMENT_ID>" --pull-root "$PULL_ROOT"
```

It replays the surviving `agent/claude-code.txt` stream through Harbor's pinned
converter. A trial whose ATIF is unrecoverable is a gate-0 `artifact_fail` discard,
not an R7.

*~10 min per task.*

**Step 6 — spot-check the grading plane offline.** One trial per task:

```
uv run python -m tools.regrade /tmp/qual/<SCENARIO>/jobs/oddish/trials/<TRIAL_ID>
```

The printed overall must equal the trial's recorded reward. A mismatch is G0.5 and
stops the protocol. *~1 min per task.*

**Step 7 — classify.** For each gradeable trial, apply §1.4 in order against
`.../verifier/rundir/deterministic-report.json` (v2) or `verdict.json` (v1), plus
`derived/incident-report.json`, `derived/mariadb-state.json`, and the ATIF
trajectory. Record the rule that fired and the field that decided it. Two independent
passes on the first task, reconciled, to confirm the order is unambiguous; single-pass
thereafter. *~20–30 min per task, ~4 h for 12 task-cohorts.*

**Step 8 — write the C4 blocks.** One §3.1 block appended to each
`scenarios/frappe/<id>/REVIEWER.md`, one per cohort. *~15 min per block.*

**Step 9 — the ladder tables.** Two composition tables (§4.2), the FP/FN citation
table (§4.5) with its 0/3 caveat, and the roll-up into
`docs/TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` §4. Re-score the C4 row per task. *~1 h.*

**Step 10 — reconcile D15.** Add the §4.3/§4.5 pointer to `docs/DECISIONS.md` D15;
leave the effect-size obligation open. *~15 min.*

### Time and cost

| step | per task | total |
|---|---|---|
| 2 preconditions | — | 5 min (hours–days if red) |
| 3 Cohort A commission + pull | 5 min pull × 7 | ~1.5–2 h wall, 4 in parallel |

| 7 classify | 20–30 min × 12 | ~4–6 h |
| 8 write-up | 15 min × 12 | ~3 h |
| 9–10 roll-up | — | ~1.25 h |
| | | **≈ 12–14 h analyst time, ~3.5 h of it waiting on compute** |

Compute: **60 trials** — Cohort A 5 × 7 tasks = 35, Cohort B 5 × 5 tasks = 25. At the
per-trial figure 06-queue-lag-bait's `REVIEWER.md` records (~$10–15 plus ~$5 EC2),
that is **≈ $900–1,200**. Neither cohort is free; the earlier reading that Cohort A
was already paid for is wrong and §2.2 records the measurement that disproves it.

If only one cohort can be funded, drop Cohort A's two non-ladder tasks (03-U1,
03-QE1) before touching Cohort B — Cohort B is the one that carries the
non-saturation claim, and a corpus whose only difficulty evidence is `glm-5p2` is
weak for a reviewer.

Every figure here is **estimated** from 03-QE1's two recorded trials and one published
per-trial cost. They are not measurements of this protocol, which has never run.

## 6. Known gaps

Stated rather than solved.

1. **No frappe task is `calibration.current` or `hosted_ready` today** (P2). Every
   number this protocol produces is void unless Step 2 is green at the promoted SHA.
   This is the one gap that blocks the whole protocol rather than qualifying a result.
2. **There is no existing GLM evidence to reuse.** Every `qualification-frappe-*`
   artifact has expired and six of seven tasks never produced one; the difficulty
   cohort is suppressed under the `task:promote` label. §2.2. Both cohorts cost real
   compute (~$900–1,200 total), and any future qualification bundle must be
   downloaded the day it is produced.
3. **600 s may make pair 1 unmeasurable.** §2.3. The disqualifier is pre-registered;
   the fix is a separate PR that re-triggers calibration on both members.
4. **R3 is transcript-only on the three redis-tier scenarios**, because
   `grader_hooks.DEFAULT_CAPTURE_SOURCE` captures MariaDB my.cnf alone. §1.6. Closing
   it needs the grader-side capture extension already tracked with the QE1
   `capture_sources` work.
5. **v2 public requirements disclose parts of the decoy map** to the agent, so
   difficulty measured on v2 tasks is measured under partial disclosure. Recorded in
   the rubric as conflict 3; not correctable here.
6. **The local lane cannot pin a model** (P6). One-line fix, not made in this PR.
7. **No trial has been run against this protocol**, so the taxonomy's mutual
   exclusivity is argued, not demonstrated. The two-pass reconciliation in Step 7 is
   the first empirical test of it; if the two passes disagree, the order in §1.4 is
   wrong and gets fixed before the remaining tasks are classified.
8. **R7 has no counterpart in SG**, so a corpus dominated by budget exhaustion cannot
   be compared to SG's 17.9% even if the raw solve rates look similar. §1.7.
9. **Slack-spine is out of scope** here. 09-I1 grades attribution as advisory, which
   collapses R5/R6; extending the protocol across substrates needs that resolved
   first (rubric conflict 4).
