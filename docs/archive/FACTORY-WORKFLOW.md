> **Archived 2026-10-07.** Historical: the conductor's runbook for the original's factory, scheduled around its Blacksmith runner pool; neither runs on this fork. Kept for the record; do not update. Current docs are indexed in [docs/README.md](../README.md).

# FACTORY-WORKFLOW — the conductor's runbook

The executable companion to [`FACTORY.md`](FACTORY.md).

`FACTORY.md` is the **why**: the nine stages, the measurements that justify their
order, the run ids that prove each one caught something. This file is the **what to
run** — the same nine stages expressed as an orchestration a conductor (human or
agent) can drive mostly unattended: which work fans out, which work queues on the one
build farm, what each stage must produce before the next may start, and the six
decisions it must refuse to make.

Nothing here supersedes `FACTORY.md`. Where this file abbreviates a criterion, the
stage card names the `FACTORY.md` section that states it in full. Where the two
disagree, `FACTORY.md` wins and this file is the bug.

**The one-sentence contract.** Every stage below has a machine-checkable **pass
predicate**, an explicit **kill predicate**, and a named **artifact**. A stage that
produced no artifact has not run — including a kill, which owes a ledger entry
([W9](#w9--kill-ledger-sink-reachable-from-every-stage)).

---

## Usage

### Invoke

```
run docs/FACTORY-WORKFLOW.md for batch <n>, candidates: <id> <id> …
```

or for a single candidate:

```
run docs/FACTORY-WORKFLOW.md for frappe/<id>, resume at W<k>
```

The conductor reads this file top to bottom, executes the stage cards in order, and
stops at every `HALT` it reaches. There is no wrapper script and deliberately so:
the stages are `gh`, `uv run`, `docker` and `git` invocations that already exist and
are already tested — a wrapper would be a second place for the pipeline's semantics
to live, and drift from `FACTORY.md` is the failure mode this document exists to
prevent.

### What runs unattended

W0 batch pre-flight, W1 desk screens, W2 authoring, W3 local verification, W4a local
semantics probes, W4b remote 1+1 probes, W5 full validation, W6 quality grading, W7
adversarial review, W8a offline stamping, and W9 ledger entries. That is every
mechanical step from "here are seven candidate mechanisms" to "here is a branch with
two shipped scenarios, five ledger entries, and a PR body written against the rubric".

### Where it stops for a human

Six hard halts (`H1`–`H6`) and four flagged judgement calls (`J1`–`J4`). See
[Human stop points](#human-stop-points). Two of them are the difference between this
pipeline and a pipeline that launders failures: **H4** (the kill trigger is written
and committed *before* dispatch) and **H5** (Tier-2 ship/kill).

### Expected cost per candidate

"Farm time" is exclusive occupancy of the single Blacksmith runner pool — the only
genuinely rationed resource. Everything else is author-hours and laptop minutes.

| outcome | stages entered | farm time | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| desk kill | W1 | **0** | most kills land here; free |
| semantics kill | W1 → W4a | **0** | `03-statement-time-cap`, zero validation runs |
| probe kill | … → W4b | ~9 min | the batch's modal paid kill |
| fence kill | … → W5 | ~34 min | 1 probe + 1 fence |
| scorecard kill | … → W6 | ~34 min + seconds | a **green** fence killed at W6 |
| ship, clean | W1 → W8 | ~34 min | 1 probe + 1 fence (`03-readonly-flag-fog`) |
| ship, review fix re-validates | + one more W5 | ~59 min | `06-queue-lag-bait` |

Batch-3's actual spend, amortised: 7 candidates consumed 3 local probes, 5 remote
probes and 4 fences ≈ **145 min of exclusive farm time, ~21 min per candidate**, and
shipped 2. Budget the batch by farm minutes, not by candidate count — the candidates
that cost nothing are the ones the ordering is for.

## The five invariants

These are not stage criteria; they are properties of the whole run. A conductor that
violates one has not run this workflow, whatever its stage log says.

| # | invariant | mechanism that enforces it |
|---|---|---|
| **I1** | **A passing validation is not a ship signal.** | W6 is a required stage with an exit predicate, not an optional report. `W5 green → W8` is not an edge in this graph; the only edge out of W5 is into W6. Twice a green fence has been graded defective — `03-conncap-noisy-cfg` (Tier 1, killed) and `04-redis-cache-oom` (passed, then graded canonically vacuous). |
| **I2** | **Never dispatch a validation before the cheap screens pass.** | The [dispatch precondition](#the-dispatch-lock) is a checklist evaluated before the lock is taken. A kill that reaches its correct stage costs about one probe; a kill that skips to W5 costs a full run. |
| **I3** | **Kill triggers are pre-registered and are not renegotiable.** | The numeric trigger is written into `REVIEWER.md` and **committed on its own commit** before `gh workflow run` executes, so git history proves it predates the run. Adjudication reads the trigger from that commit, never from the working tree. See [H4](#h4--the-kill-trigger-is-set-before-the-run). |
| **I4** | **Adversarial review means trying to BLOCK.** | W7 dispatches reviewers whose mandate is to find a defect. PASS is defined in the prompt as *"I looked for a blocker and failed to find one"* — never as an endorsement. It has caught a false enforcement claim in an answer key and an unpublished vocabulary that would have graded correct diagnoses as wrong. |
| **I5** | **Kills are deliverables.** | W9 is a sink reachable from every stage, and its artifact — a `KILL-LEDGER.md` entry with hypothesis / screen / refuting measurement *with units* / cost / revival condition — is required for the stage to be complete. A kill with no entry is an unfinished stage, not a finished candidate. |

## Concurrency contract

The only rationed resource is the Blacksmith runner pool. Everything that does not
touch it fans out; everything that does queues behind one lock token.

| stage | mode | why |
|---|---|---|
| W1 desk screens | **parallel**, one worker per candidate | reads only committed artifacts. No cluster, no network, no cost. Screening 7 candidates concurrently costs the same as screening 1. |
| W2 author | **parallel**, one git worktree per candidate | isolated trees, disjoint `scenarios/<sub>/<id>/` paths. The one shared file — `contracts/registry.yaml` — was already written in W0 precisely so these do not collide. |
| W3 local verify | **parallel** | `FACTORY.md` S3: "no cluster, no Blacksmith, no network". |
| W4a docker probe | **parallel, modestly** — cap at the laptop's cores | a bare `docker run`. Regardless of parallelism it answers **semantics and refusals only**: amd64-under-qemu distorts exactly the timing that latency/contention mechanisms depend on. Never a timing verdict. |
| **W4b remote probe** | **SERIAL — lock** | one build farm. Stacking capture + calibrate + qualification produced a **19-minute queue wait**. Fanning out N probes does not buy N× throughput; it buys N× queue. |
| **W5 full validation** | **SERIAL — lock** | same pool, and 3+3 trials each already occupy six runners. Additionally: **do not push the branch while its `/calibrate` runs** — the run aborts on "PR head moved". A parallel dispatcher that pushes a sibling candidate's commit onto a shared branch kills the in-flight run. |
| W6 scorecard | **parallel** | seconds, offline, over already-downloaded artifacts. |
| W7 review | **parallel**, and fan out **several reviewers per candidate** | reads committed bytes plus downloaded artifacts. This is the one place extra parallelism buys real coverage — see [W7](#w7--adversarial-review--parallel-fan-out-several-reviewers). |
| W8 stamp | **parallel** for 8a (offline replay of captured rundirs, no trials spent); **serialised by merge order** for 8c | two scenario PRs in flight **will** conflict on the generated `tasks/INDEX.json`. Sequence merges; do not race rebases. |

### The dispatch lock

One token. A candidate may take it only when every line below is true; the conductor
evaluates the list and records the evaluation next to the run id.

```
DISPATCH PRECONDITION  (checked before the token is taken — this is I2)
  [ ] W1 pass recorded: every listed wall cleared, every expressibility row answered,
      every decoy has a named observing probe (or outcome-only is declared)
  [ ] W1 corridor pre-check computed from committed artifacts, and it exceeds the
      profile's measured run-to-run spread                              (J1 applies)
  [ ] W3 is 7/7, or 6/7 with gate 5's only complaint being this branch's own
      base_release, and `blockers: []` in the same output
  [ ] W4a passed, or is not applicable to this mechanism and that is written down
  [ ] the branch is pushed (a probe needs a pushed branch, NOT a PR)
  [ ] the kill trigger is committed                                     (H4 / I3)
  [ ] no other Blacksmith job is in flight for this batch
```

Order, restated because inverting it is a documented cost: **desk screens → push
branch → probe → PR → full validation.** Opening the PR first buys nothing, and when
the probe kills the candidate it leaves a closed-unmerged PR as avoidable noise on a
shared repo.

While the token is held, the conductor may continue W1/W2/W3/W4a/W6/W7 work on other
candidates. It may **not** push the locked branch.

---

## Stage cards

### W0 — batch pre-flight

Runs once per batch, before any candidate is authored.

```bash
# 1. Cut the branch. If the batch needs unreleased substrate bytes to validate,
#    cut from the release branch — and read H2 now, not at merge time.
git fetch upstream && git switch -c <batch-branch> upstream/main

# 2. Pre-register EVERY handle in the batch in ONE PR, before authoring any of them.
#    N parallel scenario PRs each editing contracts/registry.yaml conflict by
#    construction. Registry additions are fingerprint-excluded, so this costs zero
#    re-verification.                                          (AUTHORING §7.5)

# 3. Ledger debts from the previous batch are this batch's first work item.
grep -n "bufferpool-squeeze" docs/KILL-LEDGER.md    # currently: no entry, no scenario
```

**Artifact:** the batch branch, the merged handle-registration PR, and a list of
open ledger debts.
**Halt:** `H2` if the branch carries image bytes. `H1` if any candidate's design
implies a `profiles.yaml` / `grader_hooks.py` / `image_build_inputs` edit.

Standing debt this workflow surfaces on first run: **`bufferpool-squeeze` is
un-adjudicated.** Its enabler shipped in v19 and its S4a semantics probe *passed*
(an allowlist GO, not a refutation), but no scenario, card or branch exists and there
is no ledger entry. Under [W9](#w9--kill-ledger-sink-reachable-from-every-stage) it
owes either a scenario or an entry.

---

### W1 — desk screens  *(parallel: one screener per candidate)*

Full criteria: `FACTORY.md` §S1. The screener is an agent with read-only tools; its
inputs are `docs/KILL-LEDGER.md` (Walls W1–W10), `docs/CAPTURE-SURFACE-GAP.md`,
`docs/AUTHORING-FRAPPE.md` §1.5, `substrates/frappe/loadgen_frappe/profiles.yaml`,
`substrates/frappe/main/reconfigure-infra.sh`, `verifier/oracle/attribution.py`, and
`substrates/frappe/health/`.

It must produce a filled screen sheet — every row answered, no row left blank:

```
CANDIDATE <id>
  WALLS       W1 concurrency density ......... clear / HIT + the measurement
              W2 login–redis-cache coupling ... clear / HIT
              W3 bring-up survival ............ clear / HIT

                                                candidate. Screen it only against a base
                                                authored BEFORE that date, and settle it
                                                by reading reconfigure-infra.sh, never by
                                                the wall's presence in the list — see
                                                Fidelity gap F2

                                                               ephemeral-storage exhaustion.

                                                               services, rate, workers]
  EXPRESSIBILITY
              dead knobs / runtime settability / driver census /
              repair-surface census / attribution expressibility /
              A3 probe naming / name budget (≤39 chars, no forbidden substrings) /
              cost envelope
  CORRIDOR    profile ......... frappe_db | frappe_dev | frappe_dev_queue | (none on
                                frappe_read, frappe_jobs — those hand-stamp bands)
              healthy value ... <n> ± <spread>   source: substrates/frappe/health/…
              faulted value ... <n>              source: the arithmetic, shown
              margin .......... <faulted − healthy> vs <spread>
```

**Pass:** every wall cleared — ten are listed, of which W5 is CLOSED and applies only
to a pre-2026-08-25 base ([F2](#fidelity-gaps)) — every expressibility row answered,
every decoy has a named observing probe (or the scenario declares outcome-only
enforcement), and the corridor exceeds the profile's measured noise.
**Kill:** any wall hit, or no corridor → **W9. Do not author.**
**Judgement (J1):** "corridor exceeds noise" has no threshold in code. The batch's
rule — a corridor is worth a probe when the predicted faulted value clears the healthy
band by more than the profile's run-to-run spread, and at `frappe_dev_queue`
specifically only if the faulted aggregate clears 40%+. The conductor computes the
numbers and **surfaces the comparison**; it does not silently apply a threshold it
invented.

The A3 screen is the one most likely to be got wrong, and the long form is
[`CAPTURE-SURFACE-GAP.md`](CAPTURE-SURFACE-GAP.md) — read its scope note before citing
it, because the usual phrasing invites the wrong fix. The operator's short form:

On Frappe `config_after` is a *normalisation of* `config_before`, so
`minimality.diff_keys` returns `[]` at **every** capture path — adding a
`minimality.capture_sources` entry does not fix it and declaring one **hard-fails the
episode**. This is **not a broken gate**: for an operational (`SET GLOBAL` /
`CONFIG SET`) repair, "no persisted config changed" is the right verdict. The real gap
is that dynamic state is graded on a separate plane which exists for MariaDB
(`mariadb_state` probes) and has **no `redis_state` peer**. So on MariaDB, declare the
decoy in `mariadb_state.probes` and leave it out of `allowed_mutations`. On the
redis/queue tier there is no such probe today: the scenario is enforced by the
**outcome gate alone** and must say so — and must not claim minimality enforcement in
`REVIEWER.md` or the answer key.

---

### W2 — author  *(parallel: one worktree per cleared candidate)*

**Route first.** This is a branch in the graph, not a footnote:

| `fault.tier` | route | why |
|---|---|---|
| `config` (the four `erpnext.*` fault families) | **card** — `tools/scenario_pipeline` | the renderer decides every structural field; the LLM only narrates |
| `runtime` (`faultInit.mariadb` / `SET GLOBAL`) | **hand-authored** | the card schema's enum accepts `"runtime"`, but `render.py` emits **no `faultInit`** and every card in `records/` is `tier: config` — there is no rendering path |

```bash
git worktree add ../wt-<id> <batch-branch>          # isolation, one per candidate

# card route
uv run python -m tools.scenario_pipeline check tools/scenario_pipeline/records/<card>.yaml
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=…
uv run python -m tools.scenario_pipeline instantiate \
  tools/scenario_pipeline/records/<card>.yaml --author
```

A card must reference an **existing** mechanism in
`tools/scenario_pipeline/mechanisms/` — `test_every_record_references_an_existing_mechanism`
rejects forward references, so a genuinely new mechanism is a fourth artifact to
write, not an inline field.

**If the candidate is a controlled variant (D15 "ladder"):** vary exactly ONE axis and
copy everything else from a fence-proven base. **Before copying the base's dial, read
the base's own scorecard grade.** D15's "hold everything constant" is about *design
axes*, not about measurement defects — `03-conncap-noisy-cfg` faithfully copied 03-F1's
`max_connections=10`, inherited its vacuity, and cost a probe plus a fence to discover.
Where the base carries a labelled defect, the rung must **deviate and document the
deviation** in the card and `REVIEWER.md`.

**Prose gates the conductor runs itself** (`tools/lint_scenario.py` deliberately does
not scan `instruction.md`):

```bash
# B1 leakage grep — every ground_truth.component leaf, every fault.injected and
# golden_fix key AND value, every mechanism_keywords entry, against instruction.md
# E2 token agreement — every service/component literal in solve.sh and instruction.md
#    against the ground_truth pair. Calibration CANNOT catch a spelling drift:
#    golden and nop hardcode the same spelling.
```

Then **publish the report vocabulary**: `task.metadata.report_vocabulary: true` (the
renderer now defaults it true). Mandatory whenever the canonical token differs from
anything visible in the cluster — grading demands `redis_queue` while every visible
name is `svc-redis-queue`. Point at `submit_incident_report --help`; do not
hand-maintain a duplicate enum in `instruction.md`.

**Pass:** five files exist (`spec.yaml`, `ground-truth.yaml`, `instruction.md`,
`solve.sh`, `REVIEWER.md`), prose greps clean, vocabulary published, one varied axis if
it is a rung.
**Kill:** the mechanism cannot be expressed within the closed fault families /
runtime allowlist; the answer needs two `(service, component)` pairs; or no decoy has
an observing gate *and* the scenario claims one anyway.

**The generalisation rule, encoded because it is a factory property and not a
scenario property:** when a defect is found on a **card-generated** scenario, the
conductor must check whether the card format can express the fix **at all** before
patching the rendered output. `report_vocabulary` was missing from *every*
card-generated scenario and present in *every* hand-authored one — a factory gap wearing
a scenario's clothes.

---

### W3 — local verification  *(parallel)*

```bash
uv run python -m tools.generate_tasks frappe/<id>
uv run python -m tools.scenario_pipeline verify frappe/<id>
```

Seven gates, cheapest and most diagnostic first: generates cleanly · answer key
internally coherent · registry H7-coherent (**the gate CI does not have**) ·
`docker_state` matches deployment · impact is clean (`classify()` blockers, accidental
base release) · fault injects as designed · scenario contract tests.

**Pass:** 7/7, or **6/7 with gate 5's only complaint being this branch's own
`base_release=['frappe']`** and `blockers: []` in the same output. That shape is
legitimate *only while the branch is being validated against a release* — once the
branch is a merge candidate the same signal is anti-pattern 5, and [H2](#h2--merge-authority)
applies.
**Kill:** any other gate red → back to W2. Verify is free; fixing and re-running
consumes no budget.
**Verify does NOT prove the fault fires.** Only a run does.

Corpus-wide, before push:

```bash
./validate.sh smoke frappe          # expect PASS=10 FAIL=0
uv run python -m pytest -q          # the FULL suite from the repo ROOT (~1722)
```

> `pytest tools/` is **not** the suite. It omits every `scenarios/` contract test —
> exactly the half that guards shipped-scenario semantics — and it has produced a
> false green. The conductor runs the root suite here even when a narrower one is
> faster.

---

### W4a — local docker probe  *(parallel, modestly)*

Question: **does the knob do what the mechanism claims, on the pinned image?**

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name mprobe -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  bitnamilegacy/mariadb:10.6.17-debian-11-r10
sleep 25
docker exec mprobe mariadb -uroot -e \
  "SET GLOBAL <variable> = <faulted>; SET GLOBAL <variable> = <repaired>;"
docker rm -f mprobe
```

Extend to whatever the mechanism actually asserts: seed to DocType shape and read
server-side durations from `information_schema.PROFILING`; boot with the rendered
my.cnf under `--cpus=1 -m 1g` and drive it with mysqlslap; read `CONFIG GET` /
`redis_evicted_keys_total` on a redis tier.

**Pass:** the knob's semantics match the mechanism at the intended dial.
**Kill:** the server refuses, clamps, or silently ignores the knob → **W9**. *A tool's
refusal is a verdict, not a puzzle* — `ERROR 1290` (`SET GLOBAL max_user_connections`
when started at 0) and `ERROR 1193` (`super_read_only` does not exist on MariaDB) each
killed a knob at a desk that would otherwise have burned runs.
**Scope limit, enforced:** use this probe for **semantics and refusals** — does the
server clamp, does it error, does the variable exist, does the value round — **never
for timing verdicts.** amd64-under-qemu distorts exactly the timing that
latency/contention mechanisms depend on. A probe abandoned for emulation bias is
recorded as *abandoned*; it is never laundered into a refutation.

---

### W4b — remote 1+1 probe  *(SERIAL — takes the lock)*

Question: **does the nop leg fail and the golden leg pass, once, on real infra?**
~9 minutes with deterministic fast-fail.

```
# H4 FIRST — the trigger, on its own commit, before the dispatch command runs.
```
```bash
git add scenarios/frappe/<id>/REVIEWER.md
git commit -m "pre-register kill trigger for <id>"
TRIGGER_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
git push -u origin <branch>          # a probe needs a pushed branch, NOT a PR

gh workflow run calibrate.yaml --ref <branch> \
  -f substrate=frappe -f scenario=<id> -f golden=1 -f nop=1 -f purpose=dev
```

**Pass:** clean split — nop reward 0, golden reward 1, against the pre-registered
trigger read from `$TRIGGER_SHA`.
**Kill:** the legs do not split, or the split is *inverted* → **W9**.
**Adjudication rule (I3):** read the trigger with
`git show $TRIGGER_SHA:scenarios/frappe/<id>/REVIEWER.md`, never from the working tree.
If any commit between `$TRIGGER_SHA` and the adjudication touched the trigger text,
that is a protocol violation → halt to a human. `06-queue-silent-loss`'s trigger
(healthy ≥ 0.85 **and** broken < 0.30) was written before probe 2 and honoured when
the result came back at 0.25 / 0.636.

The local kind probe (`scenario_pipeline probe`, ~20 min) is a **fallback when CI is
unavailable**, not the default — the remote 1+1 measures the same discrimination on the
same runner size the fence uses and does not depend on a laptop Docker VM that forces
trials serial. Some `REVIEWER.md` files still list the local probe first; see
[Fidelity gap F5](#fidelity-gaps).

---

### W5 — full validation  *(SERIAL — takes the lock)*

The FP=FN=0 fence: **3 golden + 3 nop** on kind, each trial on its own
8-vCPU/32 GB Blacksmith runner, then one aggregate job re-grades every capture with
the real oracle.

```bash
gh pr comment <PR> -R abundant-ai/sre-world --body '/calibrate frappe/<id>'
# or
gh workflow run calibrate.yaml --ref <branch> \
  -f substrate=frappe -f scenario=<id> -f golden=3 -f nop=3 -f purpose=dev
```

Artifact-only by design — nothing is committed onto the branch — but **not advisory**:
since #279 the reporting path evaluates calibration policy v2 unconditionally and
`calibrate` returns non-zero on a failed fence, so a red fence is a failed check run.

**The load-bearing criterion is fault-shaped discrimination.** The nop leg must fail
at least one **non-report** check. A nop that fails only the incident-report checks is
satisfied by any nop for any fault — it proves nothing about yours, and it is a hard
fence failure (#289).

The runner size (`blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2404`) is hard-coded, not an input.
**Do not push the branch while its `/calibrate` runs** — the run aborts on "PR head
moved".

**Pass:** golden 3/3 PASS, nop 3/3 FAIL, nop failures fault-shaped → **W6**.
**Kill or fix:** any golden failure, any nop pass, or report-shaped-only nop
discrimination.
**A red fence is not automatically a kill (J2).** Read the evidence in this order and
do **not** re-dispatch blindly:

1. the check summary line — *"every error is HealthcheckError — deterministic"* means
   the environment never went ready and a re-run fails identically;
   `validate_trial_capture` exit code **3 = deterministic, do not retry**;
2. `gh run download <run> -n calib-<scenario>-<agent>-<idx>`, then
   `failed-*/<trial>/exception.txt` — helm status, pod states, events, support-pod logs;
3. the loadgen sidecar log — `baseline_error=` is usually the exact exception that kept
   `/healthz` at 500;
4. **only** if the dump is clean, suspect a flake.

**A green fence is not automatically a ship (I1).** The only edge out of W5 is W6.

---

### W6 — quality grading  *(parallel, offline)*

```bash
gh run download <run-id> -D /tmp/ev
uv run python -m tools.task_scorecard frappe/<id> --evidence /tmp/ev
```

The primitive is the nop failed-check classification: **R** report-class (any nop fails
it) · **I** injection-presence (fails whenever the knob is injected, regardless of
service impact) · **C** impact-class (client-measured; fails only if the fault degrades
service).

| nop failure classes | tier | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| all ⊆ R | **0-VACUOUS** | do not ship — correct the dial and **re-probe (W4b)**, or kill |
| all ⊆ R ∪ I | **1-DEFECTIVE-INERT** | do not ship — same |
| ≥1 C but a blocking machine predicate fails | **2-DEFECTIVE-EVIDENTIARY** | **HALT H5** |
| otherwise | **3-PENDING-HUMAN-SIGN-OFF** | ship, pending **H3** |

The scorecard also computes the per-driver corridor (`min(nop) − max(golden)` vs
run-to-run spread) and the machine predicates `A1-stamp-current`,
`B3-counterexample-recorded`, `no-concealed-golden-retries`, `capture-sees-the-repair`
(plus `bands-inherited`, which reports **info**, not a verdict).

**It never grants SOUND/EXEMPLARY on its own.** B1, C1, C2 and `REVIEWER.md` content
quality are emitted as UNSCORED human rows — see [H3](#h3--the-rubrics-human-only-rows).

**Lateral application, unattended and free:** when a finding lands on one rung, apply it
across the rung pair **pre-fence**. `03-conncap-live-drift` cost nothing extra because
the noisy-cfg finding was applied laterally and caught the same latent defect before
its own fence.

**Corrected dial ⇒ W4b, not W5.** A corrected dial is a new mechanism, and it earns a
9-minute probe before it earns a 25-minute fence. This is the chain that discovered the
`max_connections` floor of 10 that killed the whole conncap family.

---

### W7 — adversarial review  *(parallel; fan out several reviewers)*

Run before merge, on the rendered bytes plus the run artifacts. Each reviewer is a
fresh agent with **no access to the author's summary or the PR description**. Fan out at
least two — this is the one stage where extra parallelism buys coverage rather than
queue, because independent adversaries fail to find *different* things. A single PASS
from a single reviewer is the weakest possible result in this pipeline.

The literal prompt used in the batch is not committed anywhere; this is the distilled
shape, and the constraints are what made the two findings findable
([Fidelity gap F6](#fidelity-gaps)).

```
You are an independent pre-merge reviewer for a fault-injection benchmark scenario.

Your mandate is to BLOCK. A PASS verdict is only ever "I looked for a blocker and
failed to find one" — it is not an endorsement. Finding nothing is a weaker result
than finding something.

Inputs (read these, not the PR description):
  scenarios/<sub>/<id>/{spec.yaml,ground-truth.yaml,instruction.md,solve.sh,REVIEWER.md}
  the downloaded validation-run artifacts (verdict.json, loadgen.jsonl, minimality)
  the substrate's grader/oracle source under substrates/<sub>/ and verifier/

Do these four passes, and report file:line for every claim you make:

1. ENFORCEMENT. For every enforcement claim in ground-truth.yaml and REVIEWER.md
   ("the minimality gate rejects X", "the differ grades Y unrelated", "Gate 2 fails
   this decoy"), name the file:line of the gate that would fail a violation, and
   the observed field in the run artifacts that proves it fired. If you cannot,
   mark the claim FALSE. Prose is not evidence; a gate that exists but observes a
   different surface does not count.

2. DISCOVERABILITY. For every token the grader set-matches, name the published
   surface an agent discovers its exact spelling from. If the instruction points at
   `submit_incident_report --help`, verify the task actually publishes a vocabulary
   (task.metadata.report_vocabulary). A correct diagnosis that cannot be spelled
   correctly is a scenario defect, not an agent failure.

3. LEAKAGE. Grep instruction.md for every injected/golden key and value, every
   ground_truth component leaf, and every mechanism keyword; then read it for
   direction and for sentences that pre-empt a decoy.

4. EVIDENCE. Does the run artifact support the verdict claimed? Check the nop legs'
   failed checks are fault-shaped, not report-only; check for concealed retries.

Output: BLOCK or PASS, then a numbered list of defects, each with file:line, the
measurement or code path that refutes it, and the minimal fix.
```

**Pass:** every reviewer returns PASS, **or** every BLOCK finding is fixed *and the
scenario re-validated if the fix changed the rendered bytes*.
**Kill:** a finding shows the scenario is ungradeable by construction → **W9**.
**Back edge, not optional:** a review fix that changes the rendered bytes invalidates
the run → **W5 again**. `06-queue-lag-bait` was re-validated (`32862496732`) because
the earlier run (`32812807152`) measured different bytes.

Offline decoy exercise, for any enforcement claim the reviewer cannot resolve from
artifacts — the evaluator is a pure function:

```bash
uv run python - <<'EOF'
import yaml
from verifier.oracle.mariadb_state import evaluate_mariadb_state
m = yaml.safe_load(open("scenarios/frappe/<id>/ground-truth.yaml"))
# build baseline/declaration/soak_end snapshots for every declared probe, with the
# decoy MOVED, and assert mutation_scope FAILS
EOF
```

*"A trap documented in prose is not a trap."*

---

### W8 — record and merge

#### 8a. Stamp the passed run *(automatable, offline — no trials spent)*

```bash
RUN=<run-id>; SID=<scenario-id>
sha=$(gh run view $RUN --json headSha --jq .headSha)

# GUARD (auto-halt): provenance must bind to the run's exact commit.
git diff --name-only $sha HEAD -- substrates/frappe scenarios/frappe/$SID
#   filter through tools.substrate._FP_EXCLUDE_DIRS / _FP_EXCLUDE_FILES /
#   _FP_EXCLUDE_SUFFIXES (contracts/, *.md, substrate.yaml, images.lock.json …)
#   ANY surviving hit ⇒ RE-VALIDATE, not re-stamp.  The conductor performs this
#   filter and halts on a surviving hit; it does not decide that a hit is harmless.

gh run download $RUN -p "calib-${SID}-oracle-*" -D jobs/calib-golden-$SID
gh run download $RUN -p "calib-${SID}-nop-*"    -D jobs/calib-nop-$SID

CALIBRATION_SOURCE_SHA=$sha \
CALIBRATION_ARTIFACT_NAME=calibration-evidence-frappe-$SID-$RUN \
GITHUB_RUN_ID=$RUN \
uv run python -m tools.calibrate frappe/$SID --no-run --write \
  --golden-job calib-golden-$SID --nop-job calib-nop-$SID \
  --require-golden 3 --require-nop 3

# then: confirm the bands did not move (grep the ground-truth diff for threshold keys)
# and stamp on the CURRENT branch head. If prose changed, prose first, then stamp.
```

`CALIBRATION_SOURCE_SHA` is the **evidence-binding invariant**: the stamped
`calibration.source_sha` is the commit the trials actually ran on, not the commit you
happen to be sitting on.

**Judgement residue (J3):** the *filter* is mechanical; deciding that a surviving hit
is nonetheless outside the scenario's fingerprint surface is not. `06-queue-lag-bait`
had one commit between run head and stamp head, verified by hand to touch only the
mechanism card and deleted sibling scenarios. That verification is a human call — the
conductor surfaces the diff and stops.

`calibration.current: false` on a branch mid-release is **expected, not a defect**.
Budget **one** health recapture for the whole batch after the release lands, not one
per scenario.

#### 8b. `REVIEWER.md` contents *(machine-checkable presence, human-scored quality)*

Host-side only — never copied into the agent's foothold pod. Six required sections:
**fault summary** (substrate, attribution pair, injected values, golden fix, loadgen
profile, causal distance, originating card) · **trap map** (one row per decoy: handle,
why tempting, why wrong, **and the gate that catches it** with a file/computation
reference; if the gate is outcome-only, say so and name the **ungraded residue**) ·
**rubric table** (the filled `TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` score table, honest 0/1 rows
included) · **calibration status** (run id, split, band provenance) · **empirical
verification ladder** (commands in cost order) · **validation + review record** (run
ids, what review blocked, and what is **not yet measured**).

The conductor checks the six sections exist and that every trap row names a gate. It
does **not** score section quality — that is rubric row E1, human-only ([H3](#h3--the-rubrics-human-only-rows)).

#### 8c. Merge protocol

```bash
git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD    # scenarios/ + tasks/ (+ contracts/) only
uv run python -c "
from tools.task_dev.core import classify
print(classify(repo='.', base='origin/main', head='HEAD')['base_release_substrates'])"
# must print []
```

Author the PR TL;DR as two lists against the rubric: *why this is high quality* (rows
scoring 2, each with mechanism and run id) and *what would make it better* (the honest
0/1 rows). Argue quality; do not assert it.

Two scenario PRs in flight **will** conflict on the generated `tasks/INDEX.json`. Never
hand-merge the hunks — take main's wholesale and regenerate
(`uv run --frozen python -m tools.generate_tasks --all`); if `--all` leaves the file
dirty afterwards, something else is out of sync. **Prefer sequencing merges over racing
rebases.**

**A red check is never noise.** Bypass skips the reviewer *wait*, never a *verdict* →
[H2](#h2--merge-authority).

---

### W9 — kill ledger *(sink, reachable from every stage)*

A kill is a **deliverable**. The conductor writes the entry itself; the stage is not
complete until the entry exists in `docs/KILL-LEDGER.md` under its family.

```markdown
### <n.m> <candidate-id>

- **Hypothesis:** what the mechanism was supposed to do, and what the agent would
  have had to diagnose.
- **Screen/Probe:** which stage tested it, with run ids. Name the stage by cost
  (desk / local docker probe / 1+1 probe / N validation runs).
- **Refuting measurement:** the NUMBER that closed it, with units and its source.
  Not "it didn't work" — "0 fault-attributable failures in 16,524 faulted requests".
- **Cost:** desk-only / 1 local probe / 1 probe / N runs. Note any permanent
  pipeline fixes the failure shipped as an offset.
- **Revival condition:** the specific harness change that would make it viable, or
  "none — <physics>". Say who owns it if it is a harness change.
```

Then, in the same stage:

* **If the kill generalises, add or amend a Wall** at the end of the ledger with its
  one-line measured basis. A wall is a screen future candidates run at W1 for free.
* **Park the mechanism card** — `tools/scenario_pipeline/mechanisms/<key>.yaml`,
  `status: parked`, refutation in `evidence`. A card left `active` for a dead class is
  exactly how a future author re-burns runs.
* **Poison the known-bad dial** if the class survives but the value does not:
  `uv run python -m tools.scenario_pipeline feedback poison <result.json>`, or a
  `known_bad_params` entry. Record the **bound** — a 2 MB kill bounds the floor at
  2 MB, not at 8 MB; the untried dials in between are still untried.
* **Say what the kill cost.** The ledger's cost column is what makes the economics
  auditable.

An honestly abandoned probe (emulation bias, wrong instrument) is recorded **as
abandoned**. Do not launder an abandoned probe into a refutation. Symmetrically: do not
launder a passed screen into a shipped candidate — `bufferpool-squeeze` passed W4a and
was then never authored, which is why it owes an entry.

---

## Human stop points

The conductor **stops and asks**. It does not decide, and it does not proceed on a
default. A `HALT` emits the halt id, the evidence that triggered it, the options, and
then waits for a human reply that names the halt id.

### H1 — base releases

A `profiles.yaml` edit, a `grader_hooks.py` edit, any `image_build_inputs` path —
these invalidate every calibration on the substrate and demand a `release-candidate` →
`promote-release` receipt bound to the PR number (~35 min of hosted trials + a new
tag). The conductor may **detect** the need
(`classify()['base_release_substrates'] != []`) and must stop.

### H2 — merge authority

Bypass-merging is a human grant, per instance, and only for work that genuinely blocks
further work. **A release lands through `release-candidate` → `promote-release`, never
as a side effect of another PR merging.** A scenario PR carrying image bytes is a
release performed without the ceremony: new source on `main` against the previous
release's pinned digests, and no gate reports the mismatch. Rebase the scenario onto
`main` before it becomes a merge candidate; if it genuinely cannot validate without the
unreleased bytes, **it waits for the release** — it does not ride along.

### H3 — the rubric's human-only rows

The scorecard emits them UNSCORED for a reason: **B1** symptoms-only prose, **C1**
cause-site distance, **C2** wrong-fix plausibility, **E1** `REVIEWER.md` content
quality. No mechanism scores these. **A scenario may not be declared shippable on
machine predicates alone.**

### H4 — the kill trigger is set BEFORE the run

Write the numeric trigger into `REVIEWER.md` and **commit it** before dispatching, and
do not renegotiate it afterwards. This is the single easiest place for an unattended
pipeline to launder a failure into a "promising partial result", so the mechanism is
falsifiable rather than aspirational:

```
the trigger's commit SHA is recorded next to the run id;
adjudication reads the trigger from that SHA, never from the working tree;
any commit touching the trigger text between dispatch and adjudication is a
  protocol violation and halts to a human;
`git commit --amend` on the trigger commit is forbidden.
```

A conductor that has not committed a trigger may not take the dispatch lock.

### H5 — Tier-2 ship/kill

Whether a Tier-2 scorecard failure is a shipped corpus-wide ceiling or a
scenario-specific defect is a judgement. The batch's rule, stated so the human has
something to disagree with:

> Tier 2 ships **only** when every failing predicate is either (a) a documented
> **corpus-wide ceiling** that shipped scenarios already carry, named in `REVIEWER.md`
> with its closure dependency, or (b) a **self-clearing mid-release state**. A Tier-2
> failure **specific to this scenario** is a kill.

`06-queue-lag-bait` shipped at Tier 2 with one failure of each kind
(`capture-sees-the-repair`, a corpus ceiling with a v20 closure dependency;
`A1-stamp-current`, self-clearing at the batch's post-release recapture).
`03-conncap-noisy-cfg` was Tier 1 and died. The conductor presents the failing
predicates and its classification of each; the human decides.

### H6 — real-agent trials

~$10–15 each plus EC2. **User sign-off, per dispatch.** Never batched, never inferred
from a previous approval.

### Flagged judgement calls

Not hard halts — the conductor may proceed — but it must **surface the reasoning and
the numbers**, never apply a silent threshold:

| id | call | stage |
|---|---|---|
| **J1** | "the corridor exceeds noise" has no threshold in code | W1 |
| **J2** | a red fence is not automatically a kill — read the evidence in order first | W5 |
| **J3** | a surviving fingerprint diff hit that is nonetheless outside the scenario's surface | W8a |
| **J4** | deviating from a base scenario's dial because the base carries a labelled defect | W2 |

---

## Fidelity gaps

Things `FACTORY.md` states that this workflow **cannot** encode faithfully. Recorded,
not papered over.

**Source discipline, learned by getting it wrong.** `FACTORY.md`'s own §"Known
contradictions in the sources" is *itself* a source that goes stale: three of its rows
were already out of date when this file first transcribed them (`CAPTURE-SURFACE-GAP.md`
had landed on `main`, the walls had been re-collected into one list, and W5 had been
marked CLOSED). Every row below is therefore re-derived from the **files** —
`KILL-LEDGER.md`, `reconfigure-infra.sh`, `profiles.yaml` — and a conductor must
re-derive them again rather than trusting this table. Verified against `upstream/main`
at `bef795d82`.

* **F1 — the wall count is ten, and the ledger's *entry* ordering is still scrambled.**
  `KILL-LEDGER.md` §"Walls — the standing structural screens" now carries **W1–W10** as
  one contiguous, ordered list; the earlier dispute (#295's title said 8, the batch brief
  said 10) and the appended-past-the-list disorder are both resolved. The **entries**
  are not: `### 1.6` still sits after Family 7 and `### 4.3` still sits after "Reading
  the record". Harmless to a human reader, but it mis-associates an entry for any
  screener that parses the ledger by position — read by heading, never by order.
* **F2 — W5 is CLOSED but still listed, which is its own false-kill hazard.** The stale
  "fix in flight" prose is gone: the ledger now says **CLOSED 2026-08-25** and
  `substrates/frappe/main/reconfigure-infra.sh:44-45` accepts a lowercase-word value
  alongside the unchanged integer paths, so policy-word repairs are reachable. The wall
  is nonetheless **kept in the list**, by the ledger's own note, "because scenarios
  authored before that date assume the old grammar". Two consequences: a screener that
  treats list-membership as "must clear" will still false-kill a policy-word repair, and
  a rung copying a **pre-2026-08-25 base** inherits that base's old-grammar assumption
  even though the substrate no longer enforces it. W5 is a compatibility check on the
  base, not a live screen on the candidate — and either way it is settled by reading
  `reconfigure-infra.sh`, not by the wall's presence in the list.
* **F3 — `AUTHORING-FRAPPE.md` §7 and §9 are stale.** §9 says only `frappe_db` has a
  health record (`frappe_dev` and `frappe_dev_queue` also do, captured 2026-08-21;
  `frappe_read` and `frappe_jobs` have none). §7 lists three profiles; `profiles.yaml`
  carries five. The corridor pre-check reads `substrates/frappe/health/` and
  `profiles.yaml`, not the doc.
* **F4 — D15 does not name the Frappe rungs.** As written, D15 covers the slack-clone
  ladder (03-F1/b/c), still labelled experimental. W2 applies its *invariant* to Frappe
  by analogy. A conductor cannot cite D15 as authority for a Frappe rung; it can only
  cite the batch's practice.
* **F5 — some shipped `REVIEWER.md` verification ladders list the ~20-min local kind
  probe as step 1**, while the batch's actual practice was the remote 1+1. W4b prefers
  the remote probe. Where a scenario's own ladder disagrees with this workflow, the
  disagreement is real and unresolved in the corpus.
* **F6 — W7's prompt is a reconstruction.** `FACTORY.md` states plainly that the literal
  reviewer prompt "is not committed anywhere" and that its shape was distilled from the
  two findings it produced. The version above is the best available reconstruction, not
  the artifact that caught those defects. Treat a PASS from it with corresponding
  caution.
* **F7 — the corridor threshold, the Tier-2 disposition and the human rubric rows have
  no machine form at all.** They are H3/H5/J1 for that reason. This workflow can compute
  every input to those decisions and can refuse to proceed without them; it cannot make
  them, and a version of it that appears to is misreporting.
* **F8 — two ledger claims cite session scratch, not committed artifacts** (4.2's
  per-request nop counts, 7.6's screen arithmetic). W1 screens against those rows as if
  they were measured, because the alternative is re-deriving them at CI cost. If either
  turns out wrong, the walls built on it move.
* **F9 — `bufferpool-squeeze` is un-adjudicated** and is the workflow's standing debt:
  a passed W4a semantics probe with no scenario, no card, no branch and no ledger entry.
  W0 surfaces it on every run until it owes nothing.

---

## Anti-patterns the conductor must not reproduce

Encoded from `FACTORY.md` §"Anti-patterns from this batch"; each cost is real.

1. **Copying a base scenario's known measurement defect into a variant.** Check the
   base's own scorecard grade before copying its dial. (W2, J4)
2. **Asserting an enforcement without verifying the gate exists.** Name the `file:line`
   and the artifact field that shows it fired. (W2, W7 pass 1)
3. **Scripted string-replacements that silently no-op.** Apply every scripted
   replacement **through an asserted anchor** that fails loudly if not found exactly
   once; write regression tests that call the *real* function at its real call site,
   never a mirror. All 104 `rq_complete` arrivals once died on a DRIVERS lookup with no
   record, no drop and no log line, because a unit test called a lookalike.
4. **Retrying infrastructure failures without diagnosing them.** Read in the order given
   in [W5](#w5--full-validation--serial--takes-the-lock). Exit code 3 is deterministic:
   do not retry.
5. **Stacking a scenario branch on top of a release branch.** Validate against the
   release branch; **rebase onto `main` before opening the scenario PR**. (W0, H2)
