# FACTORY — how a fault scenario gets made

Standard operating procedure for producing new fault scenarios on the sre-world
benchmark. Written 2026-08-25 from the batch-3 authoring run: **7 candidates
attempted, 2 shipped** (`06-queue-lag-bait`, `03-readonly-flag-fog`), 5 not shipped.
Every stage below caught something real in that batch; each stage's "caught" line
names the run id or the ledger entry that proves it.

Audience: an operator (human or conductor) who did not live the batch. Follow the
stages in order. **The order is the point** — each stage costs more than the one
before it and is only worth entering after the cheaper ones are green.

Companion documents, cited rather than restated:

| doc | what it is |
|---|---|
| [`KILL-LEDGER.md`](../KILL-LEDGER.md) | every refuted candidate + the **walls** (W1–W9) this SOP screens against |
| [`AUTHORING-FRAPPE.md`](../AUTHORING-FRAPPE.md) | the substrate's enforced contracts; §1.5 is the corridor method and dead-knob list |
| [`TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md`](../TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md) | the scored criteria; which are blocking and which are human-only |
| [`DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md) D15 | the controlled-variant ("ladder") policy |
| `tools/task_scorecard.py` | the tier ladder — what a *passing* fence still fails to prove |

[`FACTORY-WORKFLOW.md`](FACTORY-WORKFLOW.md) is the executable companion to this
document: the same stages as an orchestration a conductor runs mostly unattended —
what fans out, what queues on the one build farm, and the six points where it must
stop and ask. It restates criteria only in the abbreviated form a runner needs; this
document remains the authority.

## S1 — Desk screens

**What it does.** Refutes the candidate on paper, using only committed artifacts.
This is where most kills happen and it is free. Do not author anything until every
row below is answered.

### 1z. Which discriminative archetype is this? (ask FIRST — it is free and it reframes)

Name the archetype from `docs/research/TASK-ARCHETYPE-REVIEW.md` §1 that this
candidate instantiates, and record it in the card's `archetype:` field AND in
REVIEWER.md prose. `scenario_pipeline verify` warns when it is missing; it never
blocks, because a blocking gate on a judgement field just gets a box ticked.

Why this row exists, and why it is first: the archetype review cross-referenced 20
archetypes against the kill ledger and found **our kills concentrate on load-physics
designs the papers barely discuss — contention, capacity, cache pressure — while the
archetypes the papers credit with separating strong agents from weak ones sit in the
never-attempted column.** Backfilling the shipped cards made it quantitative: **6 of 8
declare `resource-exhaustion`**, the family the literature credits least.

Declaring `resource-exhaustion` is legal and honest. But a candidate that can only
answer that is competing in the category where we have already spent the most and
shipped the least, so it must clear a higher bar in REVIEWER.md: say what makes THIS
instance discriminative when the family generally is not.

### 1a. The walls (KILL-LEDGER "Walls")

A candidate must clear **all nine**. Each is the generalised form of at least one
measured kill; re-deriving one is wasted CI.

| wall | screen question | kill if |
|---|---|---|
| **W1** concurrency density | does the observable require overlapping requests? | `frappe_db` carries 50 rps × ~5 ms ≈ **0.25 in flight**. Any locking/contention/capacity mechanism needing overlap is dead (0 failures / 16,524 requests at SERIALIZABLE, run `32534466571`). |
| **W2** login–redis-cache coupling | can the fault evict or corrupt session-adjacent redis-cache keys? | login writes+reads its session key in one request and provisioning demands 32/32 logins. **4/32 logins 500'd at a 2mb ceiling** (run `32686813767`) — both legs die pre-episode, at every dial. |
| **W3** bring-up survival | is the fault live during `bench new-site` (~400 tables of DDL + bulk INSERT)? | a knob that breaks bootstrap kills both legs with no verdict. Measured floor: `max_connections < 8` fails bring-up. |
| **W4** worker-replica unrepairability | does the golden repair need to scale a Deployment? | `reconfigure-infra.sh` dispatches only `mariadb\|redis-cache\|redis-queue`; no kubectl/helm ships in the agent image. The golden leg fails by construction. |
| **W5** redis repair grammar | is the golden repair a policy **word**? | historically dead (int+kb/mb/gb only). **CLOSED by the v19 release (#298)** — `substrates/frappe/main/reconfigure-infra.sh` now accepts a lowercase-word value alongside the unchanged integer paths, so policy-word repairs are reachable. The ledger's "fix in flight" wording is stale. |
| **W6** maxclients circularity | does the fault cap redis connections? | redis has no reserved admin slot and the repair tool needs 2 fresh connections — a cap tight enough to bite makes its own repair impossible. |
| **W7** load-scaling | is the plan "raise rps until it contends"? | the clean base at 300 rps is **p90 3,302.9 ms / 31% error** against a hard SUT ceiling of 8 concurrent requests. W1 cannot be bought off with rps. |
| **W8** `max_connections` floor | does the fault set a server-wide connection cap below demand? | MariaDB clamps to a **hard minimum of 10** (`Warning 1292`); measured burst high-water is **4–6**. No legal cap can sit below demand on this web shape. |
| **W9** grading-plane blast radius | is the fault a **server-scope execution limit** (statement time, query cost, row limits, server-scope lock waits)? | the grader's own `schema_fingerprint` probe measures **3.5–4 s** and runs at BASELINE, post-activation and pre-agent. Any global execution constraint kills evidence collection and the repaired leg fails identically to the broken one. |

### 1b. Expressibility screens

| screen | question | source |
|---|---|---|
| dead knobs | is the knob on the known-dead list? | AUTHORING §1.5 (`tmp_table_size`, `max_allowed_packet`, `wait_timeout`/`interactive_timeout`, `max_connections ≥ 8`, worker `replicaCount: 0` as a fault, redis-queue `--timeout`) |
| runtime settability | for a runtime fault: is the variable settable on the **pinned image**? | MariaDB refuses `SET GLOBAL max_user_connections` when started at 0 (**ERROR 1290**); `super_read_only` does not exist on MariaDB (**ERROR 1193**). A tool's refusal is a verdict, not a puzzle. |
| driver census | which loadgen driver's `ok`/`correct` flips under the fault? | `substrates/frappe/loadgen_frappe/profiles.yaml`. No driver speaks websocket ⇒ the socketio tier is unmeasurable at any dial. |
| repair-surface census | can the sanctioned repair path express the golden fix? | `substrates/frappe/main/reconfigure-infra.sh` |
| attribution expressibility | does the answer fit **one** `(service, component)` pair? | `verifier/oracle/attribution.py` `set_match` is exact set equality against a single pair — a genuine two-fault compound has no gradable ground truth |
| **A3 probe naming** | for each decoy, **name the probe or capture path that observes it** | see [1c](#1c-the-capture-surface-screen-a3) — `allowed_keys_by_component` is not an answer on this substrate |
| name budget | `spec.task.name` ≤ 39 chars, and must not *contain* `redis-cache` / `redis-queue` / `mariadb-subchart` | AUTHORING §6; both enforced at generation since #257 |
| cost envelope | does it need a new load profile? | a `profiles.yaml` edit is a **base release** (~35 min hosted trials + a new tag) and invalidates every Frappe calibration |

### 1c. The capture-surface screen (A3)

The screen most likely to be got wrong, because the usual phrasing ("the capture
surface is my.cnf only") invites the wrong fix. The precise statement:

> On Frappe, `config_after` is a *normalisation of* `config_before` —
> `substrates/frappe/grader_hooks.py::build_config_after` is the identity for config
> purposes, pinned by `test_build_config_after_null_snapshot_is_identity`. So
> `minimality.diff_keys` returns `[]` at **every** capture path, not just redis.
> Adding a `minimality.capture_sources` entry does **not** fix this, and declaring
> one **hard-fails the episode** (`yaml.safe_load` on raw redis.conf → ParserError
> inside `_collect_episode_evidence` → `RewardFileNotFoundError`).

This is **not a broken gate**. The differ grades *persisted-config drift* by design:
for an operational (`SET GLOBAL` / `CONFIG SET`) repair the correct answer is "no
config changed". Dynamic state is graded on a *separate* plane — `mariadb_state`
probes — and that plane has **no `redis_state` peer**. That absence is the gap.

Operational consequence, and the rule to apply at the desk:

* Every decoy must name a **probe** that observes it. On MariaDB: declare it in
  `mariadb_state.probes` and leave it out of `allowed_mutations`, so a wrong repair
  fails `mutation_scope`.
* On the redis/queue tier there is **no such probe today**. A queue-tier scenario
  is enforced by the **outcome gate alone** and must say so; it must not claim
  minimality enforcement in `REVIEWER.md` or in the answer key.

Long form: `docs/CAPTURE-SURFACE-GAP.md` — **not on `main`**; it lives on branch
`fix/queue-capture-surface` (`git show 2cb156789:docs/CAPTURE-SURFACE-GAP.md`).
Read its scope note before citing it.

### 1d. The corridor pre-check

A candidate is worth authoring only if the distance between a graded signal's
**healthy baseline** and its **expected faulted value** exceeds run-to-run noise.
Everything needed is committed before any CI is spent.

```bash
# 1. the profile's healthy character, from six golden runs (raw `samples` included)
ls substrates/frappe/health/          # frappe_db, frappe_dev, frappe_dev_queue
#    frappe_read and frappe_jobs have NO record — a scenario there hand-stamps bands

# 2. per-request truth from an archived fence of a sibling scenario
gh run download <run-id> -p "calib-*" -D /tmp/ev
#    each rundir's loadgen.jsonl is one JSON line per request: driver, phase, ok

# 3. the same arithmetic the scorecard does, over that tree
uv run python -m tools.task_scorecard frappe/<sibling-id> --evidence /tmp/ev
```

Measured profile characters (2026-08-21):

| profile | healthy character | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `frappe_db` | desk drivers ~0% error, p90 2.6–7 ms | pristine — corridors start at zero |
| `frappe_dev` | + `rq_enqueue` **0.00% peak error over 6 runs** | pristine — the widest corridors on the substrate |
| `frappe_dev_queue` | desk 17.1±1.7%, `rq_enqueue` 91.9% peak / 100% trough **healthy** | noisy — graded signals breathe 5–8pp; usable corridor ≈3pp and 03-QE1 already occupies it |

The worked pair: `05-queue-idle-cut` added 1.5pp on ≥2pp noise at `frappe_dev_queue`
and died after two fences; `06-queue-write-guard` used the **same driver** at
`frappe_dev`, computed 0.00% → ~100% at a desk, and the fence measured exactly that.
**The corridor was never the driver; it was the profile.**

### Pass / Kill

* **Pass:** all nine walls cleared, every expressibility row answered, every decoy
  has a named observing probe (or the scenario declares outcome-only enforcement),
  and the corridor exceeds the profile's measured noise.
* **Kill:** any wall hit, or no corridor. Go to [S9](#s9--on-a-kill). Do not author.
* **Judgement call:** "corridor exceeds noise" has no threshold in code. The
  judgement the batch used: a corridor is worth a probe when the predicted faulted
  value clears the healthy band by **more than the profile's run-to-run spread** —
  and at `frappe_dev_queue` specifically, only if the faulted aggregate clears 40%+.

### What it caught this batch

* `03-statement-time-cap` — W9, at a desk plus one local probe, **zero validation
  runs**. Ledger 1.6.
* Batch-3's whole remaining design triage (worker scaling, socketio, redis
  maxclients, `max_join_size`/`table_open_cache`, two-fault compounds) — desk-only,
  zero CI. Ledger 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 7.5, 7.6.

---

## S2 — Author

**What it does.** Turns a cleared candidate into the five scenario files:
`spec.yaml`, `ground-truth.yaml`, `instruction.md`, `solve.sh`, `REVIEWER.md`.

### 2a. Card-based or hand-authored?

| | card (`tools/scenario_pipeline`) | hand-authored |
|---|---|---|
| when | **config tier** — the four `erpnext.*` fault families | **runtime tier** (`faultInit.mariadb` / `SET GLOBAL`) |
| why | the renderer decides every structural field; the LLM only narrates | the card schema's `fault.tier` enum accepts `"runtime"`, but `render.py` emits **no `faultInit`** and every card in `records/` is `tier: config` — there is no rendering path |
| this batch | `06-queue-lag-bait`, `06-queue-silent-loss` | `03-conncap-live-drift`, `03-readonly-flag-fog` |

```bash
# card route
uv run python -m tools.scenario_pipeline check   tools/scenario_pipeline/records/<card>.yaml
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
uv run python -m tools.scenario_pipeline instantiate tools/scenario_pipeline/records/<card>.yaml --author
```

A card must reference an **existing** mechanism in `tools/scenario_pipeline/mechanisms/`
— `test_every_record_references_an_existing_mechanism` rejects forward references,
so a genuinely new mechanism is a fourth artifact to write, not an inline field.

### 2b. Controlled variants (D15 "ladder")

D15's letter is the slack-clone causal-distance ladder (03-F1/b/c at distance 3/4/5,
still labelled experimental). Its **invariant** is what the batch applied to Frappe:
*vary exactly ONE axis; copy everything else from a fence-proven base* — workload,
peak schedule, SLO, tool catalog, episode budget, attribution schema, soak, bands.

Batch-3 rungs and their single varied axis:

| rung | base | varied axis |
|---|---|---|
| `03-conncap-noisy-cfg` | 03-F1 | distractor count 0 → 5 |
| `03-conncap-live-drift` | 03-F1 | injection tier: config → runtime |
| `06-queue-lag-bait` | 06-queue-write-guard | decoy visibility: prose-only → deployed |
| `03-readonly-flag-fog` | 03-mariadb-read-only | benign divergence count 0 → 3 |

**Copying is not free.** See [anti-pattern 1](#anti-patterns-from-this-batch): the
conncap rungs faithfully copied 03-F1's cap=10 and inherited its vacuity. When the
base carries a labelled known defect, the rung must **deviate and document it**.

### 2c. Prose requirements

* **Symptom-only instruction (rubric B1, blocking, no deterministic gate).**
  `tools/lint_scenario.py` deliberately does not scan `instruction.md`. Grep it
  yourself against every `ground_truth.component` leaf, every `fault.injected` /
  `golden_fix` key and value, and every `mechanism_keywords` entry — then read it
  once for *direction* ("raise", "restore the default") and for sentences that
  pre-empt a decoy.
* **Publish the report vocabulary.** `task.metadata.report_vocabulary: true` (card
  slot `metadata.report_vocabulary`; the renderer now defaults it **true**). It
  publishes the exact service/component spellings via `submit_incident_report --help`
  without revealing the pairing. It is **mandatory** whenever the canonical token
  differs from anything visible in the cluster — grading demands `redis_queue` while
  every visible name is `svc-redis-queue`. Do not hand-maintain a duplicate enum in
  `instruction.md`; point at `--help`.
* **Token agreement (rubric E2, blocking).** Grep every emitted service/component
  literal in `solve.sh` and `instruction.md` against the `ground_truth` pair.
  Calibration **cannot** catch a spelling drift, because golden and nop hardcode the
  same spelling.
* **`REVIEWER.md` carries the decoy map**, and each row names the gate that catches
  it — see [S8](#s8--record-and-merge) for the required contents.

### Pass / Kill

* **Pass:** five files exist, prose greps clean, vocabulary published, one varied
  axis if it is a rung.
* **Kill:** the mechanism cannot be expressed within the closed fault families /
  runtime allowlist; the answer needs two `(service, component)` pairs; no decoy has
  an observing gate *and* the scenario claims one anyway.

### What it caught this batch

* An **unpublished report vocabulary** on `06-queue-lag-bait` — a correct diagnosis
  could have graded wrong, with no way for the agent to discover the right spelling.
  Found at S7, not here.
* The generalisation is the important half: it was a **factory gap**, not a one-off.
  The card format could not express `report_vocabulary` at all, so *every*
  card-generated scenario lacked it while every hand-authored one had it. Fixed in
  `render.py` + `fault_record.schema.json`. **When a defect is found on a
  card-generated scenario, check whether the card format can express the fix at all.**

---

## S3 — Local verification

**What it does.** Runs every check CI can run locally, scoped to one scenario. No
cluster, no Blacksmith, no network.

```bash
uv run python -m tools.generate_tasks frappe/<id>          # stamp the task
uv run python -m tools.scenario_pipeline verify frappe/<id>
```

Seven gates, in order — cheapest and most diagnostic first:

| # | gate | catches |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | generates cleanly | release-name budget, subchart-alias collapse, TOML-unsafe description, `health_ref` with no record, schema violations |
| 2 | answer key is internally coherent | ground_truth ∉ own registry; `golden_fix` failing its own minimality allow-list |
| 3 | registry is H7-coherent | **the gate CI does not have** — two spellings of one service grade a CORRECT diagnosis wrong, and calibration is blind to it |
| 4 | docker_state matches deployment | a worker-zeroing scenario with no `docker_state.services` makes the restart baseline wait 300 s for pods that cannot exist; the episode never starts on **both** legs (fence `32524604384`) |
| 5 | impact is clean | `classify()` blockers, and an accidental base release |
| 6 | fault injects as designed | the overlay did not land where the answer key says |
| 7 | scenario contract tests | scenario-owned `test_*.py`, invisible to `pytest tools/` |

**The one expected failure.** On a release branch — a branch that legitimately
carries base-image bytes — gate 5 fails with `base_release=['frappe']`. That is
**6/7 green and correct**: the branch *is* the release. Every batch-3 scenario
verified 6/7 for exactly this reason. Confirm `blockers: []` in the same output;
a blocker is never expected.

Corpus-wide, before push:

```bash
./validate.sh smoke frappe          # expect PASS=10 FAIL=0
uv run python -m pytest -q          # the FULL suite from the repo root (~1722)
```

`pytest tools/` is **not** the suite — it omits every `scenarios/` contract test,
which is exactly the half that guards shipped-scenario semantics, and it has
produced a false green.

### Pass / Kill

* **Pass:** 7/7 green, or 6/7 with gate 5's only complaint being this branch's own
  `base_release` and `blockers: []`.
* **Kill:** any other gate red. Fix and re-run; verify is free.
* **Verify does NOT prove the fault fires.** Only a run does.

---

## S4 — Cheap probes

Two different probes, for two different questions. Run 4a before 4b.

### 4a. Local docker probe — *semantics*

Question: **does the knob do what the mechanism claims, on the pinned image?**
Costs nothing but minutes. It killed a candidate this batch for the price of nothing.

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name mprobe -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  bitnamilegacy/mariadb:10.6.17-debian-11-r10
sleep 25
docker exec mprobe mariadb -uroot -e \
  "SET GLOBAL <variable> = <faulted>; SET GLOBAL <variable> = <repaired>;"
docker rm -f mprobe
```

Extend it to whatever the mechanism actually asserts: seed to DocType shape and read
server-side durations from `information_schema.PROFILING`; boot with the rendered
my.cnf under `--cpus=1 -m 1g` and drive it with mysqlslap; read `CONFIG GET` /
`redis_evicted_keys_total` on a redis tier.

**Emulation caveat, stated plainly.** amd64-under-qemu on a dev laptop distorts
exactly the timing that latency/contention mechanisms depend on. The batch honestly
*abandoned* one such probe (ledger 1.5) rather than trust it. Use the local probe
for **semantics and refusals** (does the server clamp? does it error? does the
variable exist? does the value round?), not for timing verdicts.

### 4b. Remote 1+1 probe — *does it fire and repair?*

Question: **does the nop leg fail and the golden leg pass, once, on real infra?**
~9 minutes with deterministic fast-fail.

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>          # a probe needs a pushed branch, NOT a PR
gh workflow run calibrate.yaml --ref <branch> \
  -f substrate=frappe -f scenario=<id> -f golden=1 -f nop=1 -f purpose=dev
```

**Order matters: desk screens → push branch → probe → PR → full validation.**
Opening the PR first buys nothing and, when the probe kills the card, leaves a
closed-unmerged PR as avoidable noise on a shared repo.

A local `scenario_pipeline probe` (`local_run` nop + oracle on kind, ~20 min) exists
and some `REVIEWER.md` files still list it. The batch used the remote 1+1 instead:
it measures the same discrimination on the same runner size the fence uses, and does
not depend on a laptop Docker VM that forces trials serial. Prefer 4b; treat the
local kind probe as a fallback when CI is unavailable.

### Pass / Kill

* **Pass (4a):** the knob's semantics match the mechanism at the intended dial.
* **Pass (4b):** clean split — nop reward 0, golden reward 1.
* **Kill:** the server refuses/clamps/silently ignores the knob; or the legs do not
  split; or the split is *inverted*.
* **Pre-register the kill trigger before the run.** See
  [Human stop points](#human-stop-points).

### What it caught this batch

* `03-statement-time-cap` — 4a. The grader's own `schema_fingerprint` measured
  3472/4070 ms and died at every dial from 0.05 s to 2 s, while the report query the
  fault was meant to kill ran ~1 ms. **Zero validation runs spent.** Ledger 1.6.
* `06-queue-silent-loss` — 4b, twice. Probe `32864134948` at 8 MB: repaired 0.589
  vs broken 0.600, and the new telemetry gave the reason — peak queue memory 2.76 MB
  against an 8 MB ceiling, nothing was ever evicted. Probe `32867490471` at 2 MB
  rate-matched: repaired **0.25**, broken **0.636** — corridor inverted, and the
  repaired leg fell below its pre-registered 0.85 floor. Ledger 4.3.
* `05-cache-meta-thrash` (earlier batch, same mechanism) — one 9-minute 1+1 probe:
  both legs died pre-episode at 4/32 failed provisioning logins. Ledger 4.1.

---

## S5 — Full validation

**What it does.** The FP=FN=0 fence: **3 golden + 3 nop** on kind, each trial on its
own 8-vCPU/32 GB Blacksmith runner, then one aggregate job re-grades every capture
with the real oracle.

```bash
# on the PR
gh pr comment <PR> -R abundant-ai/sre-world --body '/calibrate frappe/<id>'

# or directly
gh workflow run calibrate.yaml --ref <branch> \
  -f substrate=frappe -f scenario=<id> -f golden=3 -f nop=3 -f purpose=dev
```

The fence is **artifact-only by design** — nothing is committed onto your branch.
Since #279 it is not advisory either: the reporting path evaluates calibration
policy v2 unconditionally and `calibrate` returns non-zero on a failed fence, so a
red fence is a failed check run.

**Policy v2 / fault-shaped discrimination is the load-bearing criterion.** The nop
leg must fail at least one **non-report** check. A nop that fails only the
incident-report checks is satisfied by any nop for any fault — it proves nothing
about yours, and it is a hard fence failure (#289).

The runner size (`blacksmith-8vcpu-ubuntu-2404`) is part of the calibration
environment and is hard-coded, not an input. Do not push the branch while its
`/calibrate` runs — the run aborts on "PR head moved". Run one Blacksmith job at a
time; stacking capture + calibrate + qualification produced a 19-minute queue wait.

### Pass / Kill

* **Pass:** golden 3/3 PASS, nop 3/3 FAIL, and the nop failures are fault-shaped.
* **Kill (or fix):** any golden failure, any nop pass, or report-shaped-only nop
  discrimination.
* **A red fence is not automatically a kill** — read the evidence before deciding.
  See [anti-pattern 4](#anti-patterns-from-this-batch) for the read order.
* **A green fence is not automatically a ship.** Go to S6.

---

## S6 — Quality grading

**What it does.** Classifies the fence evidence into a tier. This is the stage that
catches a *passing* validation whose passing means nothing.

```bash
gh run download <run-id> -D /tmp/ev
uv run python -m tools.task_scorecard frappe/<id> --evidence /tmp/ev
```

The primitive is the **nop failed-check classification**. Every failed check on a
nop leg is:

* **R** report-class — any nop fails it (report absence, gate2 attribution)
* **I** injection-presence — fails whenever the knob is injected, *regardless of
  service impact*
* **C** impact-class — client-measured; fails only if the fault degrades service

| nop failure classes | tier |
|---|---|
| all ⊆ R | **0-VACUOUS** — a vocabulary quiz |
| all ⊆ R ∪ I | **1-DEFECTIVE-INERT** — injected, never fires |
| ≥1 C but a blocking machine predicate fails | **2-DEFECTIVE-EVIDENTIARY** |
| otherwise | **3-PENDING-HUMAN-SIGN-OFF** |

It also computes the per-driver corridor (`min(nop) − max(golden)` vs run-to-run
spread) and the machine predicates: `A1-stamp-current`,
`B3-counterexample-recorded`, `no-concealed-golden-retries`,
`capture-sees-the-repair` (plus `bands-inherited`, which reports **info**, not a
verdict). **It never grants SOUND/EXEMPLARY on its own** — B1, C1,
C2 and `REVIEWER.md` content quality are emitted as UNSCORED human rows.

### Pass / Kill — and the judgement call

* **Tier 0 / Tier 1 → do not ship.** Correct the dial and re-probe, or kill.
* **Tier 3 → ship, pending human sign-off** on the unscored rows.
* **Tier 2 → judgement.** Read literally the ladder calls it defective, but
  `06-queue-lag-bait` **shipped at Tier 2**. The judgement the batch used:

  > Tier 2 ships **only** when every failing predicate is either (a) a documented
  > **corpus-wide ceiling** that shipped scenarios already carry, named in
  > `REVIEWER.md` with its closure dependency, or (b) a **self-clearing
  > mid-release state**. A Tier-2 failure **specific to this scenario** is a kill.

  `06-queue-lag-bait` shipped at Tier 2 with two failing predicates, one of each kind:

  * `capture-sees-the-repair` — case (a): the redis-args-outside-the-ConfigMap
    ceiling that `06-queue-write-guard` and `03-QE1` already ship with (see
    [S1c](#1c-the-capture-surface-screen-a3)). Stated in REVIEWER with its
    v20-class closure dependency.
  * `A1-stamp-current` — case (b): `calibration.current` stays `false` on-branch
    because the base image moved with this batch's own release. It clears with the
    batch's single post-release health recapture ([S8a](#8a-stamp-the-passed-run)).
    Expected mid-release, not a scenario defect.

### What it caught this batch

**Two passing validations were graded defective.** A green fence is evidence about
discrimination, not about impact — this is the stage that tells them apart.

* **`03-conncap-noisy-cfg` → Tier 1, killed.** Fence `32801918397` was **3+3
  FP=FN=0, GREEN**, and the scorecard graded it **1-DEFECTIVE-INERT**: corridor
  0.0/0.0 on both desk drivers, discrimination injection-presence-only. Root cause:
  the rung faithfully copied 03-F1's `max_connections=10`, which sits **above** the
  measured burst high-water of 4–6 — the base carries that class as a
  corpus-decision labelled pass, and D15 copying inherited the vacuity.
* **`06-queue-lag-bait` → Tier 2, shipped.** Its green fence graded Tier 2, blocked
  from 3 by `capture-sees-the-repair` and `A1-stamp-current`. Same stage, opposite
  disposition, because both failures are documented ceilings rather than scenario
  defects — this is what the judgement above is for.
* **`03-conncap-live-drift`** cost nothing extra: the noisy-cfg finding was applied
  laterally across the rung pair and caught the same latent defect **pre-fence**.

The conncap rungs were corrected to cap=6, and the correction's re-probe
(`32803045378`) then
discovered the `max_connections` floor of 10 that killed the whole family (W8). The
chain — *green fence → scorecard inert-grade → corrected dial → floor discovery* —
is the pipeline's designed sequence, not an accident.

## S7 — Independent review

**What it does.** An adversarial reviewer whose mandate is to **BLOCK**, run before
merge, on the rendered bytes plus the run artifacts. It caught two real defects this
batch, both of which every automated gate had passed.

The literal prompt used is not committed anywhere. The shape below is distilled from
the two findings it produced; the constraints are what made them findable.

```
You are an independent pre-merge reviewer for a fault-injection benchmark scenario.

Your mandate is to BLOCK. A PASS verdict is only ever "I looked for a blocker and
failed to find one" — it is not an endorsement. Finding nothing is a weaker result
than finding something.

Inputs (read these, not the PR description):
  scenarios/<sub>/<id>/{spec.yaml,ground-truth.yaml,instruction.md,solve.sh,REVIEWER.md}
  the downloaded validation-run artifacts (verdict.json, loadgen.jsonl, minimality)
  the substrate's grader/oracle source under substrates/<sub>/ and verifier/

Do these four passes, and report file:line for every claim you make:

1. ENFORCEMENT. For every enforcement claim in ground-truth.yaml and REVIEWER.md
   ("the minimality gate rejects X", "the differ grades Y unrelated", "Gate 2 fails
   this decoy"), name the file:line of the gate that would fail a violation, and
   the observed field in the run artifacts that proves it fired. If you cannot,
   mark the claim FALSE. Prose is not evidence; a gate that exists but observes a
   different surface does not count.

2. DISCOVERABILITY. For every token the grader set-matches, name the published
   surface an agent discovers its exact spelling from. If the instruction points at
   `submit_incident_report --help`, verify the task actually publishes a vocabulary
   (task.metadata.report_vocabulary). A correct diagnosis that cannot be spelled
   correctly is a scenario defect, not an agent failure.

3. LEAKAGE. Grep instruction.md for every injected/golden key and value, every
   ground_truth component leaf, and every mechanism keyword; then read it for
   direction and for sentences that pre-empt a decoy.

4. EVIDENCE. Does the run artifact support the verdict claimed? Check the nop legs'
   failed checks are fault-shaped, not report-only; check for concealed retries.

Output: BLOCK or PASS, then a numbered list of defects, each with file:line, the
measurement or code path that refutes it, and the minimal fix.
```

### Pass / Kill

* **Pass:** reviewer returns PASS, or every BLOCK finding is fixed **and the
  scenario re-validated** if the fix changed the rendered task.
* **Kill:** a finding shows the scenario is ungradeable by construction.
* **A review fix that changes the rendered bytes invalidates the run.** This is
  not optional: `06-queue-lag-bait` was re-validated (run `32862496732`) after its
  review fixes, because the earlier run `32812807152` measured different bytes.

### What it caught this batch

1. **A false enforcement claim in an answer key.** `06-queue-lag-bait`'s
   ground-truth and REVIEWER asserted that attaching a replica / mutating a decoy key
   is "graded unrelated by the differ". FALSE on this substrate — the golden leg's own
   artifact showed `minimality.mutated_keys: []` despite the repair changing a redis
   flag. Both files now state the real enforcement (outcome gate only) and name the
   ungraded residue plainly.
2. **An unpublished report vocabulary.** The instruction told the agent to use
   `submit_incident_report --help`, which fails when the scenario publishes no
   vocabulary — while attribution demands the underscore spelling in an environment
   where every visible name is hyphenated. A **correct** diagnosis would have graded
   wrong. Generalised to a factory fix ([S2c](#2c-prose-requirements)).

---

## S8 — Record and merge

### 8a. Stamp the passed run

A passed run is closed into the manifest **offline**, by replaying the run's captured
rundirs. No new trials are spent.

```bash
RUN=<run-id>; SID=<scenario-id>
sha=$(gh run view $RUN --json headSha --jq .headSha)

# GUARD — provenance must bind to the run's exact commit.
# Any fingerprint-bearing path that moved between $sha and HEAD means RE-RUN, not re-stamp.
git diff --name-only $sha HEAD -- substrates/frappe scenarios/frappe/$SID
#   filter the result through tools.substrate._FP_EXCLUDE_DIRS / _FP_EXCLUDE_FILES /
#   _FP_EXCLUDE_SUFFIXES (contracts/, *.md, substrate.yaml, images.lock.json …)
#   ANY surviving hit = re-validate instead of stamping.

gh run download $RUN -p "calib-${SID}-oracle-*" -D jobs/calib-golden-$SID
gh run download $RUN -p "calib-${SID}-nop-*"    -D jobs/calib-nop-$SID

CALIBRATION_SOURCE_SHA=$sha \
CALIBRATION_ARTIFACT_NAME=calibration-evidence-frappe-$SID-$RUN \
GITHUB_RUN_ID=$RUN \
uv run python -m tools.calibrate frappe/$SID --no-run --write \
  --golden-job calib-golden-$SID --nop-job calib-nop-$SID \
  --require-golden 3 --require-nop 3

# then: confirm the bands did not move (grep the ground-truth diff for threshold keys)
# and stamp on the CURRENT branch head. If prose changed, prose first, then stamp.
```

`CALIBRATION_SOURCE_SHA` is the **evidence-binding invariant**: the stamped
`calibration.source_sha` is the commit the trials actually ran on, not the commit you
happen to be sitting on. The batch's worked judgement call: `06-queue-lag-bait` had
one commit between the run head and the stamp head, and it was verified to touch only
the mechanism card and deleted sibling scenarios — nothing in that scenario's
fingerprint surface — so the stamp was sound. `03-readonly-flag-fog` had none.

`calibration.current: false` on a branch mid-release is **expected, not a defect**:
the base image moved, so the health record needs one recapture after the release
lands. Budget **one** recapture for the whole batch, not one per scenario.

### 8b. `REVIEWER.md` contents

Host-side only — never copied into the agent's foothold pod. Required sections, in
the shape `03-U1` and `06-queue-lag-bait` set:

1. **Fault summary** — substrate, attribution pair, injected values, golden fix,
   loadgen profile, causal distance / temporal presentation, and the card it was
   generated from (if any).
2. **Trap map** — one row per decoy: the handle, why it is tempting, why it is wrong,
   **and the gate that catches it**, with a file/computation reference. If the gate
   is outcome-only, say so and name the **ungraded residue** explicitly.
3. **Rubric table** — the filled `TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` score table, so a reviewer
   disagrees with cells rather than with vibes. Honest 0/1 rows included.
4. **Calibration status** — run id, split, band provenance.
5. **Empirical verification ladder** — the commands, in cost order.
6. **Validation + review record** — the run ids, what the independent review blocked,
   and what is **not yet measured**.

### 8c. Merge protocol

* Author the PR TL;DR as two lists against the rubric: *why this is high quality*
  (rows scoring 2, each with its mechanism and run id) and *what would make it
  better* (the honest 0/1 rows). Argue quality; do not assert it.
* Keep the cheap envelope: `scenarios/` + `tasks/` + `contracts/registry.yaml`.
  Confirm before every push:

  ```bash
  uv run python -c "
  from tools.task_dev.core import classify
  print(classify(repo='.', base='origin/main', head='HEAD')['base_release_substrates'])"
  # must print []   (except on a branch that IS the release)
  ```
* **Pre-register the whole batch's handles in ONE PR before authoring any of them**
  (AUTHORING §7.5). N parallel scenario PRs each editing `contracts/registry.yaml`
  conflict by construction. Registry additions are fingerprint-excluded, so
  pre-registering costs zero re-verification.
* Two scenario PRs in flight **will** conflict on the generated `tasks/INDEX.json`.
  Never hand-merge the hunks — take main's wholesale and regenerate
  (`uv run --frozen python -m tools.generate_tasks --all`). Regenerating is also the
  verification: if `--all` leaves the file dirty afterwards, something else is out of
  sync. Prefer sequencing merges over racing rebases.
* **A red check is never noise.** Do not bypass-merge a PR that is not blocking
  further work. Bypass skips the reviewer *wait*, never a *verdict*.

---

## S9 — On a kill

A kill is a **deliverable**, not a failure. Record it in `docs/KILL-LEDGER.md` under
its family (create a family if the mechanism opens one), in this exact shape:

```markdown
### <n.m> <candidate-id>

- **Hypothesis:** what the mechanism was supposed to do, and what the agent would
  have had to diagnose.
- **Screen/Probe:** which stage tested it, with run ids. Name the stage by cost
  (desk / local docker probe / 1+1 probe / N validation runs).
- **Refuting measurement:** the NUMBER that closed it, with units and its source.
  Not "it didn't work" — "0 fault-attributable failures in 16,524 faulted requests".
- **Cost:** desk-only / 1 local probe / 1 probe / N runs. Note any permanent
  pipeline fixes the failure shipped as an offset.
- **Revival condition:** the specific harness change that would make it viable, or
  "none — <physics>". Say who owns it if it is a harness change.
```

Then:

* **If the kill generalises, add or amend a Wall** at the end of the ledger, with its
  one-line measured basis. A wall is a screen future candidates run at S1 for free.
* **Park the mechanism card** — `tools/scenario_pipeline/mechanisms/<key>.yaml`,
  `status: parked`, with the refutation in `evidence`. A card left `active` for a
  dead class is exactly how a future author re-burns runs.
* **Poison the known-bad dial** if the class survives but the value does not:
  `uv run python -m tools.scenario_pipeline feedback poison <result.json>`, or a
  `known_bad_params` entry on the card. Record the **bound**: a 2 MB kill bounds the
  floor at 2 MB, not at 8 MB — the untried dials in between are still untried.
* **Say what the kill cost.** The ledger's cost column is what makes the economics
  below auditable.

An honestly abandoned probe (emulation bias, wrong instrument) is recorded as such —
see ledger 1.5. Do not launder an abandoned probe into a refutation.

---

## Economics

Why the order is the order. Batch-3's actual spend:

| candidate | outcome | stage that closed it | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `03-statement-time-cap` | killed | S1 + S4a local docker probe | **0 runs** |
| `06-queue-silent-loss` | parked | S4b, twice | **2 probes, 0 validations** |
| `03-conncap-noisy-cfg` | killed | S5 green → **S6 scorecard** → corrected → S4b re-probe | **1 run + 2 probes** (shared with the sibling) |
| `03-conncap-live-drift` | killed | inherited the sibling's S6 finding pre-fence, then W8 | shared with above |
| `06-queue-lag-bait` | **shipped** | S4b probe → S5 → S6 → S7 → **S5 again** after review fixes | 1 probe + 2 runs |
| `03-readonly-flag-fog` | **shipped** | S4a boot probe → S5 → S6 → S7 | 1 local probe + 1 run |
| `bufferpool-squeeze` | un-adjudicated | S4a semantics probe **passed** (allowlist GO); never authored past that | 1 local probe |

Historical comparison, from the ledger's cost column:

* `05-queue-idle-cut` — **2 full fences**, learning what archived artifacts already
  contained. The kill produced the corridor pre-check that made every later kill
  cheaper.
* `07-txn-isolation-trap` — 1 local probe + **1 full fence**, then a post-hoc
  scorecard grade of 0 fault-attributable failures in 16,524 requests. The desk
  probe's near-100% transaction overlap simply does not transfer to 0.25 in-flight.
* `04-redis-cache-oom` — **4 fence rounds**; the final round PASSED and was then
  graded canonically vacuous. Offset: the failures shipped three permanent pipeline
  fixes.
* Batch-2 — **7 candidates in, 0 shipped**, for 2 fences + 1 probe + desk arithmetic.
* Batch-3's design triage — killed its remaining classes for **zero CI**.

The trend is monotone and it is the argument for this ordering: **desk kills are
free, probe kills cost ~9 minutes, and skipping to validation costs a full run per
learning.** Every stage in this document exists because a kill once arrived at it
late.

---

## Human stop points

These decisions must **not** be automated, including by a conductor running this SOP
unattended.

1. **Base releases.** A `profiles.yaml` edit, a `grader_hooks.py` edit, any
   `image_build_inputs` path — these invalidate every calibration on the substrate
   and demand a `release-candidate` → `promote-release` receipt bound to the PR
   number (~35 min of hosted trials + a new tag). A conductor may *detect* the need
   (`classify()['base_release_substrates'] != []`) and must **stop and ask**.
2. **Merge authority.** Bypass-merging is a human grant, per instance, and only for
   work that genuinely blocks further work. A red check is never noise.
   **A release lands through `release-candidate` → `promote-release`, never as a side
   effect of another PR merging.** A scenario PR that carries image bytes is a release
   performed without the ceremony: it puts new source on `main` against the previous
   release's pinned digests, and no gate reports the mismatch. Rebase the scenario onto
   `main` before it becomes a merge candidate ([anti-pattern 5](#5-stacking-a-scenario-branch-on-top-of-a-release-branch)).
3. **The rubric's human-only rows.** The scorecard emits them as UNSCORED for a
   reason: **B1** symptoms-only prose, **C1** cause-site distance, **C2** wrong-fix
   plausibility, **E1** `REVIEWER.md` content quality. No mechanism scores these. A
   scenario may not be declared shippable on machine predicates alone.
4. **Setting the kill trigger BEFORE the run, not after seeing results.** Write the
   numeric trigger into `REVIEWER.md` before dispatching, and do not renegotiate it
   afterwards. `06-queue-silent-loss`'s trigger (healthy ≥ 0.85 **and** broken < 0.30)
   was written before probe 2 and was honoured when the result came back at 0.25 /
   0.636. This is the single easiest place for an unattended pipeline to launder a
   failure into a "promising partial result".
5. **Tier-2 ship/kill.** Whether a Tier-2 scorecard failure is a shipped corpus-wide
   ceiling or a scenario-specific defect is a judgement — see
   [S6](#pass--kill--and-the-judgement-call).
6. **Real-agent trials.** ~$10–15 each plus EC2; user sign-off, per dispatch.

---

## Anti-patterns from this batch

Each with what it cost.

### 1. Copying a base scenario's known measurement defect into a variant

`03-conncap-noisy-cfg` and `03-conncap-live-drift` faithfully copied 03-F1's
`max_connections=10`, which sits **above** the measured burst high-water of 4–6.
03-F1 carries that class as a *corpus-decision labelled* injection-presence pass;
D15 copying inherited the vacuity silently. The fence was green; the scorecard graded
it 1-DEFECTIVE-INERT.

**Cost:** one probe + one fence to discover, then two more probes for the corrected
dial — which is how the family-killing floor (W8) was found.
**Rule:** D15's "hold everything constant" is about *design axes*, not about
measurement defects. Before copying a base's dial, check the base's own scorecard
grade. Where the base carries a labelled defect, the rung must deviate and document
the deviation in the card and `REVIEWER.md`.

### 2. Asserting an enforcement without verifying the gate exists

`06-queue-lag-bait`'s answer key and `REVIEWER.md` claimed the config differ grades a
decoy mutation as unrelated. It does not: redis flags are container args outside the
capture surface, and the golden leg's own `minimality.mutated_keys: []` proved it.
The claim survived every automated gate, because no gate reads prose.

**Cost:** caught at S7 — but the fix changed the rendered task, forcing a **full
re-validation** (run `32862496732` replacing `32812807152`).
**Rule:** for every enforcement sentence, name the `file:line` of the gate and the
artifact field that shows it fired. *"A trap documented in prose is not a trap."*
Exercise the decoy offline through the evaluator — it is a pure function:

```bash
uv run python - <<'EOF'
import yaml
from verifier.oracle.mariadb_state import evaluate_mariadb_state
m = yaml.safe_load(open("scenarios/frappe/<id>/ground-truth.yaml"))
# build baseline/declaration/soak_end snapshots for every declared probe, with the
# decoy MOVED, and assert mutation_scope FAILS
EOF
```

### 3. Scripted string-replacements that silently no-op

Two instances in one batch:

* The v19 bundle registered the `rq_complete` driver in `drivers.py`. The real call
  site is `_register_frappe_drivers` in `substrates/frappe/loadgen_sidecar.py:142`,
  called from the sidecar's own main. The edit landed nowhere: **all 104
  `rq_complete` arrivals** (every seq ≡ 3 mod 4)
  died on the DRIVERS lookup with *no record, no drop, no log line*. Caught by a kind
  e2e gate (run `32790909835`), not by any unit test — the test called a lookalike
  mirror rather than the sidecar's actual function.
* The `capture-base-health` aggregate-skip edit "silently missed its anchor" because
  the `needs:` line sits between the job key and `if:`. `skip_record` therefore did
  not govern.

**Cost:** one kind e2e run, plus a second CI dispatch to fix the workflow.
**Rule:** apply every scripted replacement **through an asserted anchor** (fail loudly
if the anchor is not found exactly once). Write regression tests that call the *real*
function at its real call site, never a mirror.

### 4. Retrying infrastructure failures without diagnosing them

**Cost:** 03-U1 lost **two full runs** to MariaDB `ERROR 1290` before the failure
diagnostics existed; the v19 release failed **twice** on disk capacity (112 pods
evicted with "no space left", runs `32814666148`, `32860509591`) before anyone read
the artifact — the fix was a one-line `storage_override_mb` passthrough (#296).

**Rule — read in this order, do not re-dispatch blindly:**

1. The check summary line. *"every error is HealthcheckError — deterministic"* means
   the environment never went ready; a re-run fails identically.
   `validate_trial_capture` exit code **3 = deterministic, do not retry.**
2. `gh run download <run> -n calib-<scenario>-<agent>-<idx>`; open
   `failed-*/<trial>/exception.txt` — helm status, pod states, events, descriptions,
   support-pod logs.
3. The loadgen sidecar log is usually the answer: `baseline_error=` is the exact
   exception that kept `/healthz` at 500.
4. **Only** if the dump is clean, suspect a flake.

A tool's *refusal* is evidence, not an obstacle — MariaDB's `ERROR 1290` and
`ERROR 1193` each killed a knob at a desk that would otherwise have burned runs, and
`calibrate --write` refusing to stamp #252 **was** the verdict.

### 5. Stacking a scenario branch on top of a release branch

The most expensive one on this list, because its cost is paid on `main`.

The batch-3 scenario branch was cut from the **v19 release branch**, so the scenarios
could validate against the unreleased `rq_complete` driver. That part worked — the
validation is sound and the runs are real. But when the scenario PR merged, it carried
**every v19 source change** onto `main` while `main` still pinned the previous
release's images. Today `substrates/frappe/` carries the new driver, the widened redis
repair grammar and the extended runtime allowlists **in source**, while
`substrates/frappe/substrate.yaml` and `substrates/frappe/images.lock.json` both still
say `release: v18`.

Nothing breaks immediately — CI builds images from source, and the affected tasks are
not `hosted_ready` — but **source and pinned images disagree**. That is precisely the
state the base-release ceremony exists to prevent, and it was reached without the
ceremony ever completing.

**Cost:** `main` left inconsistent until the release lands, plus the discovery cost of
noticing at all. It surfaced only indirectly, as a dangling doc reference caught in an
unrelated source audit — nothing in CI reports it, because every gate builds from the
same source it is testing.

**Rule: validate against a release branch, but never merge a branch that contains
unreleased image bytes.** Concretely:

1. Cut the scenario branch from the release branch to get the new code for validation.
2. **Before opening the scenario PR, rebase it onto `main`**, so its diff contains only
   the scenario.
3. Confirm the diff before pushing:

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD    # scenarios/ + tasks/ (+ contracts/) only
   uv run python -c "
   from tools.task_dev.core import classify
   print(classify(repo='.', base='origin/main', head='HEAD')['base_release_substrates'])"
   # must print []  — on a rebased scenario branch there is no 'this branch IS the
   # release' exemption; a non-empty result here means unreleased bytes are riding along
   ```
4. If the scenario genuinely cannot validate without the unreleased bytes, **it waits
   for the release.** It does not ride along.

Note the interaction with [S3](#s3--local-verification): the expected `6/7` shape,
where gate 5 reports `base_release=['frappe']`, is legitimate **only while the branch
is being validated against the release**. Once the branch is a merge candidate, that
same signal is this anti-pattern — the exemption is for validation, never for merge.

---

## Known contradictions in the sources

Recorded, not silently resolved.

* **`docs/CAPTURE-SURFACE-GAP.md` is not on `main`.** PR #298's merged body cites it
  by that path; it exists only on `fix/queue-capture-surface` (`2cb156789`). Until it
  lands, cite it by branch.
* **Wall count.** `KILL-LEDGER.md` carries **W1–W9**; #295's title says 8 and the
  batch brief says 10. Nine is the count in the file.
* **W5's status.** The ledger calls it "the one wall with a fix in flight (v19
  additive word grammar)". #298 **shipped** that grammar. Verify against
  `reconfigure-infra.sh` rather than the ledger prose.
* **Ledger ordering.** Entry **1.6** sits after Family 7; entry **4.3** sits after
  "Reading the record"; **W8**/**W9** are appended past the Walls list. Structural
  only — no content conflict.
* **Two self-flagged TODO-cites** in the ledger: 4.2's per-request nop counts and
  7.6's screen arithmetic live only in session scratch, behind committed claims.
* **AUTHORING §9 is stale on health records.** It says "only `frappe_db`" has one;
  `frappe_dev.yaml` and `frappe_dev_queue.yaml` also exist (captured 2026-08-21).
  `frappe_read` and `frappe_jobs` have none.
* **AUTHORING §7 is stale on profiles.** It lists three; `profiles.yaml` carries five
  (`frappe_dev`, `frappe_db`, `frappe_read`, `frappe_dev_queue`, `frappe_jobs`).
* **D15 scope.** As written, D15 covers the slack-clone ladder (03-F1/b/c), still
  labelled experimental. The batch applied its *invariant* to Frappe rungs. D15 does
  not name them.
* **`06-queue-lag-bait`'s `REVIEWER.md` verification ladder** lists a ~20-min local
  kind probe as step 1; the batch's actual practice was the remote 1+1. See
  [S4b](#4b-remote-11-probe--does-it-fire-and-repair).
* **`bufferpool-squeeze` is un-adjudicated.** `mariadb.buffer-pool` was pre-registered
  in #293 and its enabler (`innodb_buffer_pool_size` + the chunk-size precondition
  gate) shipped in the v19 bundle, but no scenario, mechanism card, or branch exists
  and there is **no kill-ledger entry**. Lab notes checked: the only bufferpool
  measurement on record is the 2026-08-24 local docker semantics probe
  (`2026-08-21-mechanism-screens.md`, Batch-3 Phase 0), which cleared the knob for
  the runtime allowlist — *"Bufferpool allowlist item GO"* — i.e. an S4a **pass**,
  not a refutation. The candidate was enabled and then never authored. Under
  [S9](#s9--on-a-kill) it owes either a scenario or a ledger entry.
