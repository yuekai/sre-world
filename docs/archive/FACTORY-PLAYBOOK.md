> **Archived 2026-10-07.** Historical: onboarding for the original's task factory (2026-08 Frappe sprint), built on CI that does not run on this fork. Kept for the record; do not update. Current docs are indexed in [docs/README.md](../README.md).

# Task-factory playbook — from "I have a substrate" to "an in-band task on main"

**Who this is for.** An agent (or a person) onboarding onto the task factory for a substrate
they own — written for the slack-spine work, using frappe's 2026-08-26/27 sprint as the worked
example. It tells you which steps are load-bearing, which are ceremony, and every trap we hit.
It links the deeper docs instead of repeating them:

| doc | what it is |
|---|---|
| `docs/FACTORY.md` | the full S1–S9 pipeline design (desk screens → author → verify → probes → validation → grading → review → merge) |
| `docs/FACTORY-WORKFLOW.md` | the conductor's stage graph, invariants, stop points |
| `docs/DIFFICULTY-PROTOCOL.md` | how difficulty is measured and reported |
| `docs/TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` | the quality rules (the enforced gates are the table at lines 63–82) |
| `docs/SUBSTRATE-INTERFACE.md` | what a substrate must expose to the grader/loadgen |
| `tools/scenario_pipeline/README.md` | the `scenario_pipeline` CLI (mine → distill → instantiate → author → check → verify → probe → promote) |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` §7 | the merge checklist (some of it is prose, see §3 below) |

> Where this playbook and those docs disagree, **this playbook wins for now** — it reflects what
> was measured in the sprint. The disagreements are called out explicitly with a ⚠︎.

Glossary, once: *task* = a scenario directory under `scenarios/<substrate>/<id>/` plus the
generated `tasks/<substrate>/<id>/` bundle; *fault* = the thing injected into the environment;
*ground truth* = the answer key the grader scores the agent's incident report against; *profile* =
the load-generator shape the environment runs under; *health record* = the measured healthy
baseline for a profile; *trial* = one agent attempt on a task, run through Oddish; *band* = the
allowed pass-rate window.

---

## 1. The only gate that matters: agent pass rate

A task is **solvable-but-hard**. The policy on `main` (#311): agent pass rate must be in
**(0%, 60%]** — strictly above zero, at most sixty. For the frappe sprint the user relaxed the
initial band to **strictly between 0% and 100% for ANY frontier model** ("we care more about
getting results which show >0 <100% pass rate initially, for any frontier model"); under that
ruling 4/5 = 80% counts. Say which band a number was judged against when you record it.

What does **not** count as evidence of difficulty (⚠︎ contradicts the older docs' emphasis):

- **nop / oracle witnesses, FP=FN=0, probes.** They test the *instrument* (does the grader flip
  when the golden fix is applied; does it stay red when nothing is done). They say nothing about
  whether an agent can solve the task. Audit: `~/Dev/agentrepair-lab-notes/2026-08-25-nop-oracle-gate-audit.md`.
  Every one of the seven original frappe tasks passed all of them and then measured ~100% for
  `fireworks/glm-5p2` once the instrument bugs were fixed (§5).
- **Turn counts.** F1 (`03-F1-connection-cap`) took 25–57 turns and still went 4/4.

Three rules that keep the numbers honest (each was learned by getting one wrong):

1. **Read one trajectory per task before recording any number.** Five times this week a 0% or a
   100% turned out to be the instrument (a 409 at the declare window, a missing profile, a
   service-name leak), not the design.
2. **Attribute every result by experiment id**, never by task id. A task-id query spans
   experiments and mixes versions.
3. **A "surface exposes X" claim needs X in the returned data**, not in the echoed request. We
   retracted a "list_metrics is a knob search" finding for exactly this reason.

---

## 2. The loop, step by step

Run everything in your **own git worktree** (`git worktree add ../wt-<name> origin/main`); a
sibling session rewriting `loadgen-common/` mid-run made two fingerprint tests flake on a shared
checkout (sprint note, item 7). Use `uv run` for every python tool and set `PYTHONPATH=$PWD` (the tools import `ruamel` and
`tools.*` — a bare `python3` fails; without `PYTHONPATH`, `generate_tasks.py` fails too).

### 2a. Generated path (single-fault tasks)

```
# 1. fault record → check → instantiate → verify
uv run python3 -m tools.scenario_pipeline check   tools/scenario_pipeline/records/<record>.yaml
uv run python3 -m tools.scenario_pipeline instantiate <record> --substrate <substrate>
uv run python3 -m tools.scenario_pipeline verify   scenarios/<substrate>/<id>

# 2. generate the task bundle (needs the profile's health record — see trap §4.1)
#    PYTHONPATH is required: the script imports `tools.*` and fails with
#    ModuleNotFoundError without it (hit again on 2026-08-26)
PYTHONPATH=$PWD uv run python3 tools/generate_tasks.py <substrate>/<id>

# 3. local gates (these ARE the merge gates, run transitively by task-ci)
./validate.sh smoke              # lint+contracts+generate+consistency+render+identity+provenance+probe
uv run pytest -q tools           # full suite; ~1 min

# 4. PR, merge, measure (§2c)
```

`instantiate` turns a fault record into a scenario dir (`spec.yaml`, `ground-truth.yaml`,
`instruction.md`, `solve.sh`, `REVIEWER.md`); `check` validates the record; `verify` runs the
static consistency checks on the scenario. The record schema lives in
`tools/scenario_pipeline/schemas/`; frappe examples in `tools/scenario_pipeline/records/`.

### 2b. Hand-authored path (compounds — the only task-layer lever that beats the ceiling, §5)

The card renderer has **no** path for a runtime `faultInit` leg or for a multi-finding
`ground_truth_set` (verified in the sprint), so compounds are cloned from a shipped scenario:

```
cp -r scenarios/frappe/03-mariadb-read-only scenarios/frappe/03-saves-fail-and-refusals
```

then edit, in this order (each line is a trap we hit — details in §4):

1. `spec.yaml`: `id`, `slug`, `task.name` (≤39 chars, **symptom-based**), `title`; the runtime
   leg in `fault.values.faultInit.<component>` (exactly ONE variable per runtime fault —
   `substrates/frappe/checks/fault_validators.py:237-241`); the second leg in `difficulty.values`
   (config-tier allowlist: `fault_validators.py:46-60`); the inline agent-window profile block
   **byte-identical** to its other owners.
2. `ground-truth.yaml`: `ground_truth_set` = the list of (service, component) pairs; keep the
   singular `ground_truth` as the documented placeholder; `mariadb_state.allowed_mutations` /
   `required_mutations` covering every leg; `thresholds.provisional: true`; **delete** the copied
   `calibration:` block; `docker_state: {services: [svc-frappe-web]}` (§4.17). **Every task ships a v2
   `verification:` contract — only v2-graded results count (rule of 2026-08-26 19:15 ET).** Generate
   it from the answer key with `uv run python3 tools/convert_to_v2.py <id>` (it derives outcome,
   per-driver, MariaDB-state and repair-scope checks; compounds get a `canonical_report_set` check
   over the materializer's `/pairs`), then read it once.
3. `instruction.md`: **two paragraphs, nothing else** (user ruling 2026-08-26: the longer
   instructions read as "TOO descriptive and LLM generated"). Paragraph 1 = the incident as a
   user reports it, every leg's symptom, no cause words. Paragraph 2 = the bold declaration-window
   paragraph. Drop "find the cause, repair it, confirm through a peak", "keep the change
   targeted", "run submit_incident_report --help … first report is final", "grading is
   dual-gate", "you have an operator shell". Exemplar: `scenarios/frappe/03-mariadb-read-only/instruction.md`
   after the minimalism PR. No decoy pre-emption, no "restore the setting" steer, no restart-trap
   disclosure (84390's prunes, `2026-08-26-difficulty-levers-task-layer.md`).
4. `solve.sh`: repairs every leg + files one report envelope with every finding.
5. `REVIEWER.md`: which oracle (v1/v2) the task ships, the pre-registered falsifier, why the
   name is symptom-based.

Then steps 2–4 of §2a. Exemplars on main: `scenarios/frappe/03-saves-fail-and-refusals` (two
MariaDB legs; answer key repaired in #338 — clone from the post-#338 version), `06-writes-and-jobs-fail`
(MariaDB + redis-queue), `07-desk-and-queue-outage`, `07-desk-and-queue-oom`,
`07-writes-and-queue-oom`, `07-connections-and-jobs-fail`, `07-connections-and-queue-oom`.
The queue memory cap that fires deterministically is `--maxmemory 512kb` (Redis idles at ~1 MB,
measured), not 4mb.

### 2c. Measure — direct `oddish run`, one model per experiment

The `run-trial` workflow wraps this; under time pressure Lane B submitted directly (the flags
are the workflow's, `.github/workflows/run-trial.yaml:181-183`):

```
oddish run -p tasks/<substrate>/<id> -e ec2 -a claude-code -m fireworks/glm-5p2 \
  --n-trials 3 --max-trial-attempts 1 --environment-kwarg launcher=k3s
# second model:  -a codex -m openai/gpt-5.6
# third route: -a grok-build -m xai/grok-4.5 — WORKS but queues slowly (route check 9287bb65
# completed 1/1 after a 36-min wait while other keys started every tick; issue #322).
```

Rules for the trial farm (each one cost us a day or an experiment):

- **Never use our own `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.** Oddish lends the org's; `anthropic/*` routes to the
  official API with no key and 403s on both id forms (issue #322). Use glm-5p2 / gpt-5.6.
- **One model per experiment; `--max-trial-attempts 1`;** switch model only on 3/3 or 0/3.
- **Never submit against a task another session is polling** — the `run-trial` poller keys on
  task id and a new submission bumps the task version, orphaning it (issue #317, fix #319).
- **Do not cancel Oddish leases.** Admission is a round-robin ~1 start per 3-minute tick per model
  key on a 16-instance org pool; `-P high` does nothing; orphaned leases clear themselves.
- Proof-before-cohort on normal days: n=1 (max 2) on one model, read the trajectory, then n=5.
  Under a deadline with the loose band, n=3 on one model *is* the proof — but the trajectory read stays.

### 2d. Readout

One row per (task, model): experiment id, n, solves, and a one-line trajectory verdict. Classify
every fail as one of: *diagnosis* (wrong component), *repair never landed* (right diagnosis, no
write path — e.g. couldn't find the admin DSN), *grader strictness* (repaired correctly but tripped
`runtime_mutation_is_targeted`, e.g. by creating a probe user), or *instrument* (409, route, spelling).
Only the first two say anything about difficulty. Table format: §6.

## 3. What actually gates a merge (verified on `origin/main`, 2026-08-26)

The one hard rule is repository ruleset **19034983**: `task-qualification` green + one review.
Everything else is transitive or prose.

| step | enforced? | what it means for you |
|---|---|---|
| `task-qualification` + review (ruleset 19034983) | HARD | the user bypasses per PR when the red is a classifier/API failure, not content |
| `./validate.sh smoke` + full pytest (`task-ci.yaml:82,84-98`) | HARD, transitively (a red task-ci never creates the required check) | run both locally first: 5 min local vs ~45 min in CI |
| `llm-review` | job HARD, **verdict advisory** (`ci_checks/task_grade.py:29-34,353,441`) | a Reject does not block; an API/quota failure is exit 1 → bypass |
| new scenario dir → `fast-fence` | **excluded** from offline tasks (`task-qualification.yaml:153-156` → `qualification_plan.py:42`) | **a new scenario needs no fence, no probe, no stamp to merge** |
| edit to an EXISTING scenario's ground-truth | `offline-regrade` HARD — needs a fingerprint-matched, unexpired `/calibrate` artifact | **author compounds as new dirs, never as edits** |
| image bytes (`substrates/<s>/loadgen_*`, `loadgen-common/loadgen/**`, Dockerfiles) | `base-release-proof` HARD, unskippable | no image change unless you have a release day |
| `generate_tasks`: profile's health record must exist (`tools/generate_tasks.py:720`); `thresholds.provisional` explicit | HARD | ride an existing profile, or capture first (§7) |
| `hosted_ready`, `≀ downgraded`, `/calibrate --write` stamp, C4 evidence, CONTRIBUTING §7 step 4 | prose / bare `print()` | skip |
| capture-base-health | `golden ≥ 5` in the workflow | only for a NEW profile |

**Keep / skip** (⚠︎ contradicts `FACTORY.md` S4–S5 emphasis):

| step | verdict | why |
|---|---|---|
| smoke + pytest locally before every push | keep | they are the transitive gate |
| `generate_tasks` | keep | no task without it |
| trajectory read per task | keep | the only thing separating "in band" from "instrument" |
| 3-golden/3-nop fence, 1+1 `/calibrate` probe, oracle/nop hosted witnesses, `--write` stamp | **skip** | not consumed by any merge gate for a new dir; teach nothing about agents |
| n=1 proof before n=3 | relaxed under a deadline | see §2c |

Bypass-merge protocol (the user runs it; recorded so the shape is known): snapshot the ruleset →
add a `pull_request` bypass actor → `gh pr merge --squash --admin` → restore → verify the ruleset
is byte-identical. Non-blocking PRs are never bypass-merged; a red check is never "noise" until
its cause is read.

## 4. Traps and their fixes (every one was hit in the sprint)

Sources: `~/Dev/agentrepair-lab-notes/2026-08-27-sprint-results.md` ("What tripped the
clone→green path", items 1–9, by session 19624), `2026-08-25-oddish-403-and-gate-floor.md`,
and this session's rework loops on C1/C3.

**4.1 `generate_tasks` aborts MID-WRITE on a missing health record** — it had already deleted
half the cloned task dir. `git checkout -- tasks/` restores it. Author the profile, capture its
health (`.github/workflows/capture-base-health.yaml --ref <branch>`), commit the record, THEN point
a scenario at it. (item 1)

**4.2 The declare window.** `agent_timeout_sec` must fit inside the profile's
`declare_deadline_s`; frappe's profiles inherited `dev`'s 150 s, so 15/15 agents that solved the
task were refused with `409 declaration_deadline_elapsed` (`loadgen_sidecar.py:929-934`,
`runner.py:533-546`). Fix: an inline profile in the spec's `loadgen.profilesYaml`
(`frappe_db_agent` 3030 s; `frappe_dev_agent` cold shape + loop) — task-layer, no release. Every
0% you see, check this first.

**4.3 Aggregate bands cannot be both hand-written and `health_ref`-inherited** — the generator
refuses `p99_ms_by_phase` / `error_rate_max` / `goodput_min_ratio` if `health_ref.inherit` lists
them. Keep only `provisional` and any `by_driver` slice. (item 2)

**4.4 A cloned `ground-truth.yaml` carries stamps that must go:** the `calibration:` block
(fingerprints of the SOURCE), `provisional: false`, and for a v1 task the `verification:` block.
(item 3; C3 rework loop)

**4.5 Shared inline profiles must be byte-identical in every owner spec** — `calibrate_base`
dies on "conflicting definitions". Copy; never re-indent or re-comment. (item 4)

**4.6 Names are visible to the agent.** The Helm release is `hb-` + `task.name` and shows up in
Service names from the operator shell even with service links off (#324 closed the env-var leak).
Name by SYMPTOM (`desk-and-queue-outage`), never by cause (`usercap-queueguard`); `task.name` ≤39
chars, the dir id may be longer. (item 5; C3 rename)

**4.7 The v1/v2 grader is chosen by the ABSENCE of a `verification:` block** — nothing names it.
⚠︎ Superseded on 2026-08-26: **only v2-graded results are valid**; every frappe task now carries a
contract (`0fb12cf00`). The v2 incident-report materializer counts findings against
`ground_truth_set` and exposes `/findings` plus scalar `/pairs` ("service/component") so a compound
contract can `set_equals` the whole set — a missing pair and an extra pair both fail. Use
`tools/convert_to_v2.py`; never ship a task without `verification:`.

**4.8 `archetype:` is a fault-RECORD field, not spec metadata** — the impact classifier blocks any
unknown key under `task.metadata` (`tools/task_dev/core.py` "unrecognized spec metadata field").
Put archetype prose in `REVIEWER.md`. (C3 rework loop)

**4.9 One spelling per service token, consistently.** Shipped frappe registries use `redis-queue`
(hyphen) in the 07-* compounds and `redis_queue` (underscore) in `06-writes-and-jobs-fail`; each task
is internally consistent and both pass. What breaks is MIXING spellings inside one task (the
`scenario_pipeline` H7 coherence check). Copy the registry from the scenario you clone and keep its
spelling everywhere: registry, `ground_truth_set`, `minimality`, `solve.sh`. (C1, C7/C8)

**4.10 `ground_truth_set` and the trusted impact classifier.** Until PR #333 lands,
`tools/task_dev/core.py` reports "unrecognized ground-truth semantic section ground_truth_set" and
`task-qualification` goes red on every compound PR. The classifier runs from `main`, so a PR can
never fix its own gating — the fix must land first. (#331, #332)

**4.11 Scripted edits: assert every anchor, read raw lines.** Comment-stripped views are not the
file; insert after a wrapped sentence's LAST line. (item 6)

**4.12 Measure constants, don't model processes.** The queue-OOM cap took <1 min with a local
`docker run redis:7` and replaced a rate×payload model that had been wrong twice. (item 9)

**4.13 Stacked-PR trap.** A PR based on another PR's branch merges into that branch once the
base squash-merges; it then needs a re-land onto main (#327/#328 → #329).

**4.14 `generate_tasks` prints `≀ <id>: the '<profile>' base-health record is STALE … resolved bands
are hypotheses`** for every new id on a profile whose record predates the current image. Prose only
(§3): it does not block, and provisional bands are what the sprint ships. A recapture is a release-day
item.

**4.15 Agent-isolated shells** (worktree subagents) refuse `cd`-prefixed and multi-`&&` commands;
put multi-step sequences in a script under the scratchpad and run that.

**4.17 A task without `docker_state.services` never opens its episode on the lean profile.** The
sidecar's restart baseline waits 300 s for the default service list (workers, scheduler, socketio),
which the lean profile zeroes, then fails — the agent sees "episode not started yet". Every task
declares `docker_state: {services: [svc-frappe-web]}`. (rq-eviction-trap, a351407f)

**4.18 The canonical registry is closed.** A new component (`mariadb.grants`, `redis_queue.acl`)
must be added to `substrates/frappe/contracts/registry.yaml` (host-side) or the bind check fails;
the per-scenario `component_registry` must list it too.

**4.19 GHCR release tags are immutable and aborted promotes still push images.** Before a promote,
check `gh api orgs/abundant-ai/packages/container/sre-world%2F<image>/versions` for the next free
`vN`; frappe's v19 and v20 were burned by failed promotes on 2026-08-25.

**4.20 Bring-up failures run ~30% on the hosted pool** (ssh dropping mid `helm install`, rc=255).
A counted cohort needs 3 VALID trials: top up with a same-bytes experiment of the missing count.

**4.16 Hosted container budget.** The node's ~38 GiB fs is exhausted by the containerd native
snapshotter copying a 2.6 GB rootfs per container; ≥10 erpnext containers die. Compounds zero the
`worker.*`, `scheduler`, `socketio` replicaCounts in `difficulty.values` (03-F1 `spec.yaml:120-130`)
→ 5 containers, hosted-safe.

---

## 5. The ceiling, and the levers that beat it

**Measured ceiling (frappe, `2026-08-26-difficulty-levers-task-layer.md`):** every single-fault
task is a readable MariaDB global; agents `SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES` over the root DSN and match the
odd value against the report vocabulary. With the window fixed and the leak closed, every original
task saturated (~100% glm-5p2). Post-lever readouts: `03-mariadb-read-only` glm 2/3 (in band under
the loose rule; the fail was grader strictness), gpt-5.6 3/3; F1 gpt-5.6 2/3 (experiment `79eece7f`).

**Verified shortcuts** (each needs the agent to have done no diagnosis):

| shortcut | status |
|---|---|
| report vocabulary lists the fault-named component | open (task-layer; a decoy-rich vocabulary is the mitigation) |
| self-describing error text (ERROR 1290 "--read-only option") | open; inherent to some faults |
| `DB_ADMIN_DSN` root creds in env | open — **the measured pass/fail discriminator** (gpt-5.6 found it 1/3, glm 5/5); closing it needs the non-SUPER account (release tier) |
| service-link name leak in env vars | **closed** by #324 |
| "list_metrics is a knob search" | **retracted** — the surface filters `mysql_global_variables_*`; the finding matched echoed input. Don't re-chase. |

**Task-layer lever that works: scope.** Two faults, a two-pair `ground_truth_set`, a grader that
fails "fixed one, declared". Each leg reused in ≤3 compounds. The second leg is ungraded by the
config differ and graded by the driver signal it breaks — so the profile must run that driver
(a redis-queue leg is invisible on `frappe_db`, which has no enqueue driver: `profiles.yaml:20-22`).

**Release-tier levers, deferred** (image bytes → `base-release-proof` + a recapture): non-SUPER read
account routed through the admin sidecar (the sidecar is a stub: `frappe-admin.yaml:14-16`, no
volume — today it would make MariaDB tasks unrepairable), healthy-no-fault with empty-declare
opt-in, grant revocation (injector kind), delayed activation, noise. One release, one recapture,
then re-measure — consequential, because the DSN is the discriminator.

---

## 6. Timing — what the loop costs (measured, frappe sprint)

| stage | measured |
|---|---|
| clone → green local smoke, one compound (C2) | **8 min 17 s** |
| two compounds sharing a profile (C4 + C5) | **5 min 09 s** for both |
| one compound with two rework loops (C1: registry spelling; classifier gap) | ~55 min |
| two compounds by a fresh agent following this playbook (C7 + C8, start → PR URL) | **12 min 24 s** (edits 7:15, generate 0:21, smoke 1:14, suite 2:12, PR 0:44) |
| image change (grant-revocation injector): code + tests → PR → candidate → promote → merge | ~2 h 10 min (of which candidate 4 min, promote 4 min ×3 attempts on burned tags) |
| v2 contracts for ten tasks (script-derived) + regenerate + suites + merge | ~50 min |
| `./validate.sh smoke` local | ~2 min; `uv run pytest -q tools` ~1 min |
| merging `main` into a task branch | `tasks/INDEX.json` conflicts every time — resolve by taking main's copy and re-running `generate_tasks` for your id, never by hand |
| task-ci in CI (smoke + full pytest) | ~20 + ~25 min |
| PR open → bypass merge | ~5 min once the user is available |
| Oddish admission | ~1 start / 3-min tick per model key; a n=3 cohort starts over ~10 min |
| one trial (glm, 1800 s budget) | 4–14 min wall for solvers; up to the budget for failures |

Record your own rows in the same shape; the timing table is the factory deliverable that lets
the loop be budgeted for the next substrate. Results table shape (one row per task×model):

```
| task | model | experiment | n | solves | band? | trajectory verdict (one line) |
```

## 7. Checklist for a new substrate (slack-spine), in order

What the factory needs from the substrate — check each against what slack-spine has today
(`substrates/slack-spine/`: `checks/fault_validators.py` + `test_slack_fault_validators.py`,
`health/{write_async_agent,write_eval,p1_shell_distractor_eval_1h}.yaml`, profiles
`slack_session*` in `loadgen-common/loadgen/profiles.yaml:68-90`, drivers in
`loadgen_slack/drivers.py`; scenarios `scenarios/slack-spine/06-F3-split-sequencer` … `13-P1-distractor-volume-shell`).

1. **A profile per task family whose `declare_deadline_s` fits the agent budget** (§4.2). If a
   family needs a new shape, define it inline in the spec's `loadgen.profilesYaml` — task-layer.
2. **A base-health record for every profile you point a scenario at** (`golden ≥ 5` via
   `capture-base-health.yaml`, ~45 min on Blacksmith). Do this before any `generate_tasks` (§4.1).
3. **Fault validators / allowlists** (`checks/fault_validators.py`): which knobs the runtime tier
   may hold (one variable per fault), which config-tier paths are allowed. A compound's second leg
   must be on the allowlist.
4. **Drivers whose signals a second leg breaks** — the profile must run the driver, or the leg is
   invisible to the grader. Check `drivers.py` against the fault you plan.
5. **A report vocabulary with decoys** (`report_vocabulary: true` in the spec; write-guard lacked
   it — a validity defect). The vocabulary is a shortcut (§5); make it wide.
6. **A canonical component registry** with underscore service tokens (§4.9), copied from a shipped
   scenario of the same substrate.
7. **Close the env leaks you can at the task layer**: no cause-named releases (§4.6); check what
   the operator shell's env and DNS expose (`checks/leak_probe.py` exists for slack-spine).
8. **Pick two shipped scenarios to clone from** — one per grader style (v1 exact-set, v2) — and
   write the compound list with the pre-registered falsifier per row before authoring anything
   (§2b step 5).
9. **Measure first**: n=3 on one model per task, own experiment each, read a trajectory, then
   fill the table (§2d). Switch models on 0/3 or 3/3; reclassify instrument vs design before
   switching.
10. **Freeze and report**: per-stage timings, the yield funnel (records → merged → measured → in
    band), the exact list with experiment ids, and the release-tier items you deferred.
