# Task-quality rubric

A checklist for scoring a scenario draft **before** spending compute on `/calibrate`.
It is calibrated against four existing scenarios (§4) and every criterion names the
repo mechanism that backs it — or says plainly that nothing does. It is usable without
reading the source papers; the citations are there so each claim can be checked.

Companion file: [`TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md`](archive/TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md) lists what
the papers argue for that the pipeline does not do yet. The long-form evidence base —
33 criteria each traced to a paper section and a repo mechanism — is
[`research/TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md`](research/TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md); this sheet is
the scored subset an author actually fills in. It is kept separate on purpose:
adopting this rubric does not sign an author up for pipeline work.

## 1. How to use it

1. Score the draft against §3. Every criterion is **✅ met / ⚠️ partial / ❌ not met / — n/a**.
2. A ❌ on any **blocking** criterion means: do not dispatch `/calibrate` yet — the fence
   cannot tell you about it (most blocking criteria are things FP=FN=0 is structurally blind
   to: token spelling, unenforced decoys, ungraded components, leaked instructions).
3. **should-fix** items are expected to be ✅ before the PR leaves draft; **nice-to-have**
   items are recorded in `REVIEWER.md` if not met.
4. Put the filled score table in `REVIEWER.md` under a `## Rubric` heading so the reviewer
   can disagree with specific cells instead of re-deriving them.

Relation to the other quality surfaces:

* `./validate.sh smoke` (lint, contracts, generate `--check`, consistency, render,
  identity, provenance, probe) and `docs/AUTHORING-FRAPPE.md` §1–§9 are **prerequisites**,
  not rubric items. If smoke is red, stop here. They are listed in §2 so nobody re-scores
  them.
* `ci_checks/rubric-sre-world.toml` is the **advisory LLM** rubric behind `/grade`
  (maintainer-only, paid). Where a criterion below overlaps one of its 26 criteria the
  name is given, so a `/grade` verdict can be read against this sheet. This rubric is the
  deterministic-where-possible, author-side subset; `/grade` judges semantics this sheet
  cannot.
* `docs/LESSONS.md` "Authoring contracts" is where several of these rules were first
  written down after an incident; this sheet turns them into a scored checklist.

Scoring convention for the totals in §4: ✅ = 1, ⚠️ = 0.5, ❌ = 0, n/a excluded.

---

## 2. Prerequisites (already gated — not scored)

These are enforced by code or CI and are satisfied by every scenario in §4. They are
listed so the author knows they exist; a rubric row would add nothing.

| gate | mechanism | catches |
|---|---|---|
| answer-key leak lint | `tools/lint_scenario.py` via `validate.sh lint` (scans `substrates/<sub>/main/` and the obs template's metric surface — **not** `instruction.md`) | golden/injected values co-occurring with their knob, fault component ids, framing words (`fault`, `golden`, `oracle`) on the agent-visible image |
| cross-file consistency | `tools/check_task_consistency.py` (HARD: answer pair ∈ own registry; `golden_fix` ⊆ allow-list of the answer component; WARN: `mechanism_keywords`, missing reviewer notes) | answer outside its own registry; golden that fails its own minimality gate |
| fault-overlay confinement | `substrates/<sub>/checks/fault_validators.py` (`validate_config_tier` / `validate_runtime_tier`), dispatched by `tools/generate_tasks.py` | overlay outside the closed families; empty overlay; runtime variable outside the allowlist |
| runtime activation contract | `substrates/frappe/loadgen_sidecar.py::_mariadb_runtime_fault_plan` | probe/baseline/value_type/required_mutations mismatch (terminal) |
| capability declaration | `generate_tasks::_validate_fault_capability_declarations` | runtime fault without `mariadb.runtime_global_variables` |
| render / identity / provenance / probe | `validate.sh` targets; `checks/leak_probe.py` (no kubectl in `main`, grader capability private, runtime fault activation private, telemetry egress isolated) | the fault not rendering; task chart ≠ substrate chart; grader reachable from the agent |
| report vocabulary | `task.metadata.report_vocabulary: true` → `submit_incident_report --help` (AUTHORING-FRAPPE §5) | the canonical spelling being undiscoverable when it differs from DNS |
| recognized paths, name length, profile-is-a-release-surface | AUTHORING-FRAPPE §6–§8; `tools.task_dev.core.classify` | unknown scenario path; helm admission failure; unbudgeted base release (scored separately as D2 because it is a design choice, not a typo) |

## 3. Criteria

Format per criterion: **severity** · why (paper) · repo mechanism · how to check · the
`/grade` criterion it overlaps, if any.

### A. Oracle soundness — can this task be graded at all?

#### A1. The fence has run on the current bytes — blocking

*Why.* Every one of the three papers treats "the reference solution passes and the broken
state fails, on the shipped artefact" as the admission test, not an afterthought: SG's
`CONTRIBUTING.md` requires a `/validate-problem` line on any PR touching
`sregym/conductor/problems/`, and `tests/integration/validate_problem.py` runs
deploy → inject → **oracle fails** → recover → **oracle passes**, refusing a problem with no
oracle or a fault that "did not break the application" (SG repo; paper §2.4 p.5 "validated
end-to-end"). AX's three-stage validation ends with a human gold solution that "passes all
tests with a 100% score" (§3.1 p.3, Fig. 3). DG verifies "fail-to-pass transitions" by
execution before a task ships (App. C.1 p.17) and reports ~10 expert-hours per reproduced
monitoring/build issue (§3.1 p.4).

*Mechanism.* `tools/calibrate.py` / `/calibrate <sub>/<id>` — 3 golden + 3 nop, FP=FN=0;
`--write` stamps `calibration.{base,layer,profile,grader,calibration_surface,…}_fingerprint`,
and `tasks/INDEX.json` `hosted_ready` drops when any fingerprint moves
(`CONTRIBUTING.md` §4–§5).

*Check.* `ground-truth.yaml` → `calibration.golden_pass == "3/3"` and `nop_fail == "3/3"`,
**and** the evidence is current: `tasks/INDEX.json` → that task's
`calibration.{base_current,layer_current,policy_current,health_current,current}` all `true`,
or run `uv run python -m tools.generate_tasks <sub>/<id>` and read any
`≀ <id>: policy v2 evidence is stale for …` line (it names which surface moved).
A fence that passed on older bytes is ⚠️, not ✅ — it is evidence about a different system.
On `origin/main` today **no** task has `calibration.current: true`: 03-F1 is stale for the
qualification surface; 09-I1 for grader, calibration surface and qualification surface, and
its bands are unproven against a health record (`health_version` unstamped, AUTHORING-FRAPPE §11).

*Overlaps.* `/grade calibration_honesty`.

#### A2. Diagnosis is graded on the component axis, not only the service — blocking

*Why.* SG's diagnosis oracle scores **fault localization** separately from the repair:
"right originating component, distinguished from downstream victims, no healthy component
blamed" (§2.5 p.6, Table 6 p.17), and its τ=7/9 threshold is chosen so a submission cannot
pass "while missing an entire dimension". SG also measures why this matters: mitigation
succeeds 22–62% of the time *with a wrong diagnosis* — "the agent often pattern-matches a
known symptom to mitigation actions" (§3.3 pp.8–9, Table 5). DG grades the diagnosis as
a separate file-and-string check from the repair (§3.3 p.7) and notes "coincidental fixes"
that pass repair with a wrong monitoring conclusion (§4.2 p.10). AX is the negative
example: it grades the repair only (F2P/P2P), so it cannot see any of this — which is the
gap D3 exists to close.

*Mechanism.* `verifier/oracle/attribution.py`: v1 Gate 2 is set-equality on
`(service, component)` against `ground_truth` plus registry membership — automatic.
verifier-v2 (`verification:` block) grades only what its `outcome.checks` list: the pair is
graded **only if** both `canonical_report_service` *and* `canonical_report_component`
(or an equivalent pointer into `derived/incident-report.json`) are present.
`mechanism_keywords` are scored but **never gating** (`MECHANISM_OK_THRESHOLD` is
telemetry), so the component check is the only thing that separates "right service, wrong
knob" from a pass.

*Check.* `grep -n "incident-report.json" scenarios/<sub>/<id>/ground-truth.yaml` — both
`/service` and `/component` pointers must appear under `verification.outcome.checks` with
`requirement_ids` that trace to a public requirement. For a v1 scenario (no
`verification:` block) this is satisfied by construction.

*Worked example.* PR #234 (03-U1) shipped with `canonical_report_service` only: an agent
that restored `max_user_connections` and then named `mariadb.max-connections` — the decoy —
would have passed. Fixed the same day.

*Overlaps.* `/grade sound_dual_gate`, `outcome_verified`.

#### A3. Every decoy is *observed* by a gate that can fail it — blocking

*Why.* SG's mitigation oracles are "state-based … probe live environment health rather than
relying on alert suppression" (App. B pp.18–19); its generic `MitigationOracle` captures the
baseline deployment set explicitly because otherwise "every replica check below would be
skipped, letting 'scale to 0' and 'delete the deployment' pass" (repo
`sregym/conductor/oracles/mitigation.py`). DG: "judging whether a build process is
successful" needs both no errors *and* that "the built artifacts correctly realize their
required functionalities" (§3.2 p.5). `LESSONS.md`: "A trap documented in prose is not a
trap."

*Mechanism.* Two, and they observe different surfaces:

* **Runtime state** — `verifier/oracle/mariadb_state.py`:
  `mutated = {probe | baseline ≠ declaration}`, `unexpected = mutated − allowed_mutations`
  → `mutation_scope` fails. So a decoy knob becomes mechanically wrong by being declared as a
  **probe** and left **out of `allowed_mutations`** (the 03-U1 `max_connections` pattern;
  AUTHORING-FRAPPE §3). `stable_probes` is declaration-vs-soak_end and does *not* catch an
  over-repair.
* **On-disk / values config** — `verifier/oracle/minimality.py` diffs
  `config_before` vs `config_after` and compares the changed keys to
  `minimality.allowed_keys_by_component[<answer>]` with `max_unrelated_mutations`. It only
  sees **captured paths**. On Frappe the capture source is the MariaDB ConfigMap `my.cnf`
  only (`substrates/frappe/grader_hooks.py::DEFAULT_CAPTURE_SOURCE`
  → `sut/config/mariadb.yaml`). A Redis or worker knob named in `allowed_keys_by_component`
  is **not observed** — the allow-list is then decorative. slack-spine additionally has
  `db_state`, `lock_state`, `seq_integrity` channels and v2 `repair_scope` JSON pointers.

*Check.* For every row of the decoy map (E1), write down *which probe or capture path*
observes that knob. Then exercise it offline — the evaluator is a pure function:

```bash
uv run python - <<'EOF'
import yaml
from verifier.oracle.mariadb_state import evaluate_mariadb_state
m = yaml.safe_load(open("scenarios/frappe/03-U1-user-conn-cap/ground-truth.yaml"))
probes = m["mariadb_state"]["probes"]
def snap(**v):  # one phase; every declared probe needs an entry
    return {"probes": {p: {"ok": True, "value": v.get(p, 0)} for p in probes}}
# correct repair PLUS the decoy: restore the per-account ceiling and also raise the server-wide cap
snaps = {"baseline":    snap(max_user_connections=8, max_connections=200, performance_schema=True),
         "declaration": snap(max_user_connections=0, max_connections=500, performance_schema=True),
         "soak_end":    snap(max_user_connections=0, max_connections=500, performance_schema=True)}
r = evaluate_mariadb_state(snaps, m)
assert r["checks"]["mutation_scope"]["pass"] is False, r["checks"]["mutation_scope"]
print("decoy fails mutation_scope:", r["checks"]["mutation_scope"]["unexpected"])
# -> decoy fails mutation_scope: ['mariadb.max_connections']   (run 2026-08-19 against PR #234's key)
EOF
```

For a config-tier decoy, confirm the knob's path is inside the substrate's capture source
before trusting `allowed_keys_by_component`.

*Overlaps.* `/grade minimality_calibrated`, `anti_cheat_robustness`.

#### A4. The load profile exercises the faulted corridor and the graded signal is client-measured — blocking

*Why.* SG's mitigation oracle "uses both client-side observability such as user request
success rate and system-side observability" (§2.5 p.6) and its API proxy hides the load
generators so an agent cannot dismiss the traffic as synthetic (repo
`sregym/service/k8s_proxy.py`, `HIDDEN_LABELS`). DG's monitoring tasks are built around a
client container that "sends normal requests (establishes baseline)" then "triggering
requests (reproduces the issue)" (repo `tasks/end_to_end/README.md` §1.3) and anomalies
must "manifest within 5–15 minutes" (§3.3 p.6). `LESSONS.md`: the authoritative signal
"must be client-measured and private".

*Mechanism.* The loadgen measures latency/error/goodput and writes them to the private
grader volume; `checks/leak_probe.py::check_grader_capability_private` keeps it out of the
agent's reach. Which corridor is graded is a function of the profile's drivers
(`substrates/<sub>/loadgen_*/profiles.yaml`, `docs/LOADGEN-PROFILES.md`); `thresholds.by_driver`
isolates a single driver when the aggregate is noisy. `CONTRIBUTING.md` §3: "Only fault
corridors the loadgen actually exercises are gradeable."

*Check.* Name the driver whose `ok`/`correct` flips under the fault. If the builtin profile
does not touch the faulted path, the nop will *pass* and the fence fails at compute cost — or
you need a profile, which is D2's problem.

*Overlaps.* `/grade functional_verification`.

#### A5. Durability is sized to the fault's recurrence, including restart — should-fix

*Why.* SG's metastable oracle requires "recovery now and **after replaying the temporary
load trigger**" (repo `sregym/conductor/oracles/search_rate_retry_mitigation.py`); App. B
quantifies the alternative: 44% of ITBench mitigation problems are "solved" by a generic
pod-restart loop because "the fault injector loses track of the pod after it is restarted"
(p.18). App. D.1: "only fixing the trigger would not mitigate the symptoms". `DECISIONS.md`
D3: dwell + soak "must be sized per fault to its recurrence period".

*Mechanism.* `dwell_cycles` / `soak_cycles`; `mariadb_state.soak_persistence`
(`stable_probes`); `thresholds.allow_fault_induced_restarts`; verifier-v2
`verification.challenge` (`fixed_pod_restart`, as in 09-I1) for faults a restart re-arms or
a restart clears.

*Check.* State in `REVIEWER.md` (a) what a pod restart does to the fault and to the golden
repair, and (b) whether the soak covers at least one full peak after declaration. If a
restart re-arms the fault, declare a challenge; if a restart *clears* the fault, make sure a
restart-only repair cannot pass (A3/B3).

*Overlaps.* `/grade real_fix_not_bandaid`.

### B. Non-shortcuttability and leak resistance

#### B1. The instruction states symptoms only — no knob, value, direction or decoy verdict — blocking

*Why.* AX withholds the failing tests precisely so "models … must interrogate production
logs … and trace root causes" (§1 p.2, §4.1 p.6) and checks "that task prompts align with
the source documents provided to the model" (§3.1 p.3); it buries 10–20 symptom lines in
500–1,000 normal log lines (§4.1 p.6). DG drops faults that crash because "immediate crashes
can be simply identified through console outputs or error logs, limiting the opportunity to
evaluate an agent's diagnostic capability" (§3.3 p.6). SG: inject "faults, not symptoms"
(§2 p.3). `LESSONS.md`: enumerating the key metrics in the instruction "is a hint that makes
the clean run easier".

*Mechanism.* **None deterministic.** `tools/lint_scenario.py` deliberately does not scan
`instruction.md` (its docstring: "curated agent-facing prose"). Only `/grade
symptom_not_fix_instruction` and `semantic_answer_key_nonleak` (advisory) and human review
cover this.

*Check.* Grep `instruction.md` for every `ground_truth.component` leaf, every
`fault.injected` / `golden_fix` key and value, and every `mechanism_keywords` entry; then
read it once for *direction* ("raise", "restore the default", "the dashboards do not show …")
and for sentences that pre-empt a decoy.

*Recorded conflict.* verifier-v2 `public_requirements` are, by design, disclosed to the agent
and every check must trace to one (`tools/verifier_v2/contract.py`). A scope rule such as
"the server-wide connection cap … must remain unchanged" (03-U1 `U1-DB-SCOPE-1`) or "do not
mask the fault by increasing connection capacity" (09-I1 instruction) therefore tells the
agent which decoy is wrong. That is a compliance test, not a diagnosis test. The rubric
records this tension between v2 transparency and trap secrecy; it does not resolve it.

*Overlaps.* `/grade symptom_not_fix_instruction`, `semantic_answer_key_nonleak`,
`essential_difficulty`.

#### B2. The registry has symmetric, plausible siblings; the answer is not the odd token out — should-fix

*Why.* SG argues strict-label oracles are brittle because "predefined labels are often
ambiguous and not mutually exclusive" (§2.5 pp.5–6) — our answer is a closed, published
registry, which shifts the risk to the answer being *guessable from the list*. DG includes
"Normal Cases" (14.3% of monitoring tasks) because agents "generat[e] significant false
positives" when nothing is wrong (§3.3 p.6, §4.2 p.9) — discrimination among plausible
labels is the skill.

*Mechanism.* `component_registry` (closed set; attribution rejects off-registry tokens);
`DECISIONS.md` D7 uniformity (the slack-spine `fault_validators` assert the faulted knob
exists across peer roles; on Frappe the validator is confinement-only, so symmetry is the
author's job); `check_task_consistency` only checks membership, not shape.

*Check.* Read the registry as the agent sees it via `submit_incident_report --help`:
(1) does the answer's service have ≥2 components at the same depth, (2) does a peer service
carry the same taxonomy, (3) is every service token in one spelling convention? A lone
underscore service among hyphenated ones, or a `.capacity` that exists on exactly one of two
otherwise-identical Redis instances, is a tell.

*Overlaps.* `/grade decoy_plausibility`.

#### B3. Counterexamples are executed, not asserted — blocking

*Why.* SG's `/validate-problem` check "must be green before merge" and its App. B catalogues
the two standard exploits (disable the injector; clear the alert by restarting) with the
44% number (pp.18–19). AX's second validation stage is "test validation to ensure that the
test suite faithfully evaluates the request without reward hacking" (§3.1 p.3) and screens
tests for brittleness, "whether tests are implementation-agnostic" (§4.1 p.6). DG observes
one-shot `top` "occasionally yielding coincidental correct results on error-free instances"
(§4.2 p.9). `LESSONS.md`: a probe script that describes the expected verdict "and never
execute[s]" leaves "the scenario's central claim … unverified". AUTHORING-FRAPPE §10:
"exercise your decoy … and confirm it FAILS".

*Mechanism.* `tools/run_verifier_v2_matrix.py` runs `scenarios/<sub>/<id>/qualification/matrix.yaml`
over `STANDARD_CASES` = reference, alternative-valid, no-op, restart-only,
traffic-suppression, destructive-repair, guardrail-disablement, broad-overrepair,
paraphrased-report-valid, perfect-report-wrong, endpoint-bypass, evidence-restart
(PASS set: reference, alternative-valid, paraphrased-report-valid). **verifier-v2 only** — a
v1 scenario "would die at `run_verifier_v2_matrix.py:253`" (PR #229 body). For Frappe today
the executable substitute is the offline `evaluate_mariadb_state` exercise in A3 plus a
recorded result in `REVIEWER.md`. Note that the standard set has no *correct repair + wrong
attribution* case — the exact shape of the #234 defect (see IMPROVEMENTS §2).

*Check.* v2: `uv run python -m tools.run_verifier_v2_matrix --scenario scenarios/<sub>/<id> --validate-only`
then a live run of at least `reference`, `no-op` and the scenario's own decoy case.
v1 / Frappe: the A3 snippet, pasted with its output into `REVIEWER.md`.

*Overlaps.* `/grade anti_cheat_robustness`.

### C. Difficulty and realism

#### C1. The symptom site differs from the cause site, and the published telemetry does not name the knob — should-fix

*Why.* SG's localization dimension is explicitly about victims vs origin, and its
metastable problems are built so "the constraint produces no errors and no failed traces; it
is discoverable only through explicit inspection of deployment configuration" (App. D.1).
AX measures a 20.9-point drop from one-service to multi-service tasks (§7 last ¶). DG wants
"subtle variances between normal and buggy cases" over crashes (§3.3 p.6). `DECISIONS.md` D1
makes causal distance the headline claim and obliges it to be "operationally defined and
measurable".

*Mechanism.* **None for distance** — `task.metadata.causal_distance` is hand-declared;
`generate_tasks.py` only copies it. For telemetry, `lint_scenario._scan_obs_metric_surface`
scans the obs template for a **hardcoded Postgres token list** (`OBS_FORBIDDEN`:
wraparound, xid, vacuum …) — it does not derive tokens from the scenario and is effectively
inert on Frappe.

*Check.* Write the hop chain in `REVIEWER.md` (symptom → … → knob). Then `list_metrics()`
as the agent would (or read `substrates/<sub>/contracts/metrics.yaml`): if an exported series
is named after the answer knob, the declared distance is shorter than claimed. Record it;
do not necessarily change it (03-F1 is the deliberate ladder base).

*Overlaps.* `/grade difficult`, `metadata_truthful`.

#### C2. A plausible wrong fix exists and is the scenario's discriminator — should-fix

*Why.* SG: agents "treat the first plausible anomaly as the target failure" (§3.1 p.7, App.
D.3) and "pattern-match a known symptom to mitigation actions" (§3.3); App. D.1 builds
compound faults where the obvious action is insufficient. DG §4.2 p.10: similar code-level
manifestations "enable coincidental fixes". The ladder design in `DECISIONS.md` D15 holds
everything constant except the thing that should bite.

*Mechanism.* This is design, enforced through A3 and graded through A2; it has no gate of
its own. The `/grade` rubric asks the same question semantically.

*Check.* The decoy map (E1) names at least one repair that a good on-call would try first,
passes the outcome gate, and fails attribution or scope. A base-of-ladder scenario may
legitimately have none — say so.

*Overlaps.* `/grade difficult`, `agentic_diagnosis`.

#### C3. Golden and nop are separated with margin, and the golden run is healthy — should-fix

*Why.* DG reports five-run stability (σ ≈ 2 points, §4.3 p.11, Table 2) and grades
repairs as a ≥30–50% improvement over a *recorded* baseline, not "any improvement" (repo
`tasks/end_to_end/README.md` §5.4). AX averages Pass@1 over three epochs and shows a
12.8-point shift between its two task sets (§2 p.3, App. B) — small-n fences drift. SG runs
every (agent, model, problem) three times (§3 p.6). A fence that passes 3/3 + 3/3 with the
golden at goodput 0.11 and the nop at 0.02 is a coin on its edge.

*Mechanism.* `tools/calibrate.py` prints golden/nop spreads and fits bands at
golden-max + 10 pt error / golden-min − 20 pt goodput; the delivery channel refuses a floor
when "nop max … too close to golden min". **There is no margin assertion on error/goodput**
and the fence is binary.

*Check.* Read the calibration evidence artefact (or `calibrate --no-run` output). On the
discriminating signal the golden minimum should clear the nop maximum by more than the
band's own margin, and the golden run should look like a healthy service
(aggregate `goodput_min_ratio ≥ 0.9`, `error_rate_max ≤ 0.05` unless `REVIEWER.md` explains
why the driver is inherently lossy).

*Overlaps.* `/grade calibration_honesty`, `sound_dual_gate`.

#### C4. There is difficulty evidence from a real agent — nice-to-have

*Why.* SG: problems ported from prior benchmarks are solved >80% by Stratus/Sonnet and
"introduce limited challenges" (§3.2 p.7); SG-native ones fall to 17.9% E2E (Table 4). AX:
"all of the models we evaluated fail to reliably solve the tasks" is a design goal (§1 p.2);
HumanEval/MBPP and SWE-bench Verified are dismissed as saturated (§1, §7). DG: 17% of
failures are "inherently difficult", "confirming that the benchmark captures … high-difficulty
scenarios rather than contrived or artificially simple problems" (§4.2 p.9).

*Mechanism.* `tools/oddish_qualification.py` `REAL_AGENT_MAX_MEAN_REWARD = 0.60` — five GLM
trials with mean reward in `(0.00, 0.60]`, required by `task-qualification`
(`CONTRIBUTING.md` §7). **slack-spine only today**: Frappe carries
`qualification.automatic: false`. Locally: `tools/local_run.py --agent claude-code`.

*Check.* `REVIEWER.md` records ≥1 real-agent trial (model, budget, reward, what the
transcript shows it tried). One timed-out run is weak evidence, but it is evidence.

*Protocol.* [`DIFFICULTY-PROTOCOL.md`](archive/DIFFICULTY-PROTOCOL.md) specifies what would
turn this row green: the failure-mode taxonomy (an ordered, transcript-derivable
decision procedure), n = 5 per (task, model) and what that n does and does not buy,
the `## C4 — difficulty evidence` block this row is scored from, and the run sheet.
No trials have been run against it.

*Overlaps.* `/grade difficult`.

### D. Calibration and cost hygiene

#### D1. Outcome bands are inherited from the base-health record — should-fix

*Why.* DG makes a *recorded* healthy baseline a mandatory artefact
(`tests/vul_performance.json`, generated by `monitor_container.sh -d 180`, repo e2e README
§5.2) and grades against it; SG keeps a live baseline of the deployment set before it will
evaluate anything (`mitigation.py`). A band lifted from a sibling scenario is a hypothesis,
not a measurement.

*Mechanism.* `health_ref: {inherit: [p99_ms_by_phase, error_rate_max, goodput_min_ratio]}`
from `substrates/<sub>/health/<profile>.yaml` (`_HEALTH_INHERITABLE`); a key declared in
both `health_ref` and `thresholds` is rejected; `generate_tasks` dies if the record is
missing. The Frappe record `substrates/frappe/health/frappe_db.yaml` landed on `main`
2026-08-19 (#242). AUTHORING-FRAPPE §9.

*Check.* `grep -n "health_ref" ground-truth.yaml`; the three inheritable keys are absent from
`thresholds`. A scenario on a profile with no record cannot inherit — that is a D2 cost,
not a D1 pass.

*Overlaps.* `/grade calibration_honesty`.

#### D2. The cost envelope is the cheap one, or the base release is budgeted — should-fix

*Why.* SG names composability/extensibility as benchmark-quality properties ("Composability
is key to scaling problems"; bespoke per-problem scripts are the anti-pattern — §2 p.3, §1
p.2) and exposes 3,623 viable (fault, target) pairs from one runtime (§2.4). A scenario that
needs its own load profile is a bespoke script in that sense.

*Mechanism.* `tools.task_dev.core.classify(...)['base_release_substrates']`:
`loadgen_frappe/profiles.yaml` is inside `base_fingerprint` **and** a release surface —
touching it invalidates every Frappe calibration and demands a `release-candidate` →
`promote-release` receipt bound to the PR (~35 min; AUTHORING-FRAPPE §7, `LESSONS.md`).
`contracts/registry.yaml` and `checks/` do not trip it.

*Check.* `uv run python -c "from tools.task_dev.core import classify; print(classify(repo='.', base='origin/main', head='HEAD')['base_release_substrates'])"`
→ `[]`. Otherwise `REVIEWER.md` says why the builtin peak cannot fire the fault and budgets
the release.

### E. Reviewability

#### E1. `REVIEWER.md` carries the decoy map and the gate that catches each decoy — should-fix

*Why.* SG: "Automated validation does not replace human review" (`CONTRIBUTING.md`); DG's
reference `solution.sh` must write the root cause as `file:line` so a reviewer can check the
answer, not just the verdict (e2e README §5.6); AX's rubrics are "created by experienced
engineers who worked on the task" (§5 p.9).

*Mechanism.* `check_task_consistency` WARNs on a missing reviewer write-up; nothing checks
its content. 03-U1's `REVIEWER.md` is the reference shape: what the incident is, why it is
hard, decoy map (handle · why tempting · why wrong), *how the trap is enforced* (file and
computation), why the predicate is what it is, calibration status and open questions.

*Check.* Each decoy row names a gate from A3; each open question names what would settle it.

*Overlaps.* `/grade reviewer_context_quality`.

#### E2. Every emitted token agrees with the answer pair — blocking

*Why.* SG §2.5: "agents often report correct results, but are incorrectly evaluated due to
mismatching brittle labels" — in a closed-vocabulary oracle the cost of a spelling drift is a
false negative on a correct diagnosis. `LESSONS.md`: the same bug "appeared twice in one
scenario" (`solve.sh`, then `instruction.md`), and "calibration cannot catch it, because
golden and nop both hardcode the same spelling".

*Mechanism.* `attribution.py::_canon_token` casefolds and strips `svc-` **and nothing else**;
`check_task_consistency` checks the answer pair is *in* the registry but does not read
`solve.sh`'s report payload. So: grep.

*Check.*
```bash
S=scenarios/<sub>/<id>
uv run python -c "import yaml;g=yaml.safe_load(open('$S/ground-truth.yaml'))['ground_truth'];print(g['service'],g['component'])"
grep -n '"service"\|"component"' $S/solve.sh
grep -n -i 'service\|component' $S/instruction.md | grep -v help
```
Every literal must be the canonical underscore form from `contracts/registry.yaml`.

*Overlaps.* `/grade typos`, `test_instruction_alignment`.

## 4. Calibration of the rubric against existing scenarios

Scored 2026-08-19. 03-F1 and 09-I1 on `origin/main`; 03-U1 on PR #234
(`feat/frappe-user-conn-cap`, after the component-check fix); 03-QE1 on PR #229
(`feat/frappe-03qe1-port`).

| # | criterion | sev | 03-F1 | 03-U1 | 03-QE1 | 09-I1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | fence run on current bytes | B | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| A2 | component graded | B | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| A3 | decoy observed by a gate | B | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| A4 | load hits corridor, client-measured | B | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| A5 | durability / restart | S | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| B1 | symptom-only instruction | B | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| B2 | symmetric registry | S | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| B3 | counterexamples executed | B | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ |
| C1 | symptom ≠ cause; telemetry silent | S | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| C2 | plausible wrong fix exists | S | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| C3 | golden/nop margin | S | ✅ | — | ❌ | ✅ |
| C4 | real-agent evidence | N | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| D1 | bands inherited | S | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| D2 | cost envelope | S | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| E1 | REVIEWER decoy map | S | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| E2 | token agreement | B | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| | **total** | | **9.0 / 16** | **10.5 / 15** | **8.5 / 16** | **13.5 / 16** |
| | **blocking ❌** | | B3 | A1 | A3, B3 | A2 |

The totals differ and the blocking failures differ in kind, which is the point: the
*calibrated, merged* scenario (03-F1) is not the top scorer, and the one with the most
pipeline evidence (03-QE1, two calibration runs and two real-agent trials) is the lowest.

Per-cell justifications (one line each; the full reasoning is in the criterion text):

**03-F1-connection-cap** (config tier, merged, `provisional: false`)
A1 ⚠️ 3/3+3/3 on 2026-08-17; base, layer, profile and grader fingerprints are current on
`main` but `generate_tasks` reports the policy-v2 evidence "stale for qualification surface"
(`calibration.current: false` in `tasks/INDEX.json`); the in-flight `health_ref` conversion
will move more — re-score then. A2 ✅ `canonical_report_component`. A3 ✅
`wait_timeout` is probe-not-permitted and `unrelated_globals` fingerprints the rest.
A5 ⚠️ the accepted repair is `SET GLOBAL`, which a MariaDB restart reverts to the faulted
`my.cnf`; the oracle requires the on-disk config to stay *unchanged* (`F1-CONFIG-SCOPE-1`),
so the durable fix is forbidden and the non-durable one is graded — fine for one soak, but
say so. B1 ⚠️ "find out what is saturating … don't disturb unrelated database state" points
at the DB. B3 ❌ no matrix, no recorded decoy exercise. C1 ⚠️ `mysql_global_variables_max_connections`
is an exported series named after the answer knob; declared distance 3 collapses to a
dashboard read (acceptable for the ladder base — record it). C2 ❌ none by design. C4 ❌
no real-agent trial recorded in the scenario. D1 ❌ hand-stamped on `main`. E1 ❌ no
`REVIEWER.md`.

**03-U1-user-conn-cap** (runtime tier, PR #234, first runtime scenario)
A1 ❌ `/calibrate` re-dispatched after all six trials died on `HealthcheckError` at cap 5;
verdict pending at cap 8. A2 ✅ after today's fix (was ❌ — the worked example). A3 ✅
`max_connections` probe-not-permitted. A5 ⚠️ a runtime fault is *cleared* by a MariaDB
restart; whether the agent can cause one and whether restart-only would then pass
`required_mutations` is not analysed anywhere — open question for `REVIEWER.md`.
B1 ⚠️ three steers: "dashboards … do not show the server approaching its limits" pre-empts
the decoy, "trust what the server is reporting" names the path, "restore … to its documented
server default" is needed for the `eq: 0` predicate (recorded conflict, justified in
`REVIEWER.md`). B3 ⚠️ enforcement documented; no evidence the decoy was run through
`evaluate_mariadb_state`. C3 — uncalibrated. C4 ❌. D1 ❌ bands lifted from 03-F1
(conversion planned). E1 ✅ reference-shape `REVIEWER.md`.

**03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap** (config tier on redis-queue, PR #229, v1 oracle)
A1 ⚠️ 3/3+3/3 on 2026-08-13 but on base fingerprint `db3657…`; the new profile moved it and
the PR body says the carried bands "are not evidence on these bytes". A3 ❌ the LRU-flip trap
and even `golden_fix` live under `sut/values/redis-queue.yaml`, which the Frappe grader never
captures (`DEFAULT_CAPTURE_SOURCE` is MariaDB only; PR body "Known gap") — the minimality
gate passes vacuously. A5 ⚠️ `CONFIG SET` is reverted by a redis restart (fault and fix).
B1 ✅ symptom-only; the long template enumerates metric families, a mild dial. B2 ❌ the
published vocabulary has one underscore service (`redis_queue`) among hyphenated peers, and
`.capacity` exists on the queue but not on the otherwise-identical cache — the answer is the
odd token out. B3 ❌ the matrix was removed because the v1 oracle cannot run it. C3 ❌
golden `rq_enqueue` goodput 0.11 vs nop 0.02; aggregate `error_rate_max 0.35`; the golden
run fails 89% of the discriminating driver. C4 ⚠️ one Opus-5 trial, timed out mid-diagnosis.
D1 ❌ hand-stamped, and `frappe_dev_queue` has no health record to inherit from. D2 ❌ new
profile → `base_release_substrates == ['frappe']`, stalled. E1 ✅ decoy map + verification
ladder + trial notes.

**09-I1-seq-lock-leak** (slack-spine image tier, merged)
A1 ⚠️ 3/3+3/3 on 2026-08-13; `generate_tasks` reports the evidence stale for grader,
calibration surface and qualification surface, and the bands unproven against a health
record (`state_note` says the same in prose). A2 ❌ by
design: "report wording, attribution, and mechanism are advisory and do not determine repair
reward" — conflicts with D3 and with every Frappe scenario; recorded, not resolved. A5 ✅
verifier-owned `fixed_pod_restart` challenge, 4-cycle soak. B1 ⚠️ "do not mask the fault by
increasing connection capacity" pre-empts the pool decoy (v2 public-requirement conflict).
B3 ✅ 16-case matrix. C4 ⚠️ Oddish qualification pending per `REVIEWER.md`. D1 ✅
`health_ref`. E1 ✅ terse but maps envelopes to controls.

### Criteria deliberately not scored

* **Realistic incident / native injection vehicle** — every scenario passes; the tier
  validators constrain the vehicle and `/grade realistic_incident` judges plausibility.
  Dropped as non-discriminating.
* **Metadata truthfulness** (`causal_distance`, `temporal_emergence`, `fault_presentation`)
  — no mechanism and, under the house convention (`rubric-sre-world.toml
  metadata_truthful`: `committed` + `temporal_emergence: true` is valid), all four are
  consistent. Operational causal distance is an improvement item (IMPROVEMENTS §6).
* **Report vocabulary published** — all four `true`; AUTHORING-FRAPPE §5 is the rule.
  Listed under prerequisites.
* **Contamination resistance** — none of the three papers' mechanisms (DG's
  prefix-completion screen, AX's held-out set + canary, SG: none) map to a purpose-built
  synthetic SUT; nothing here enforces it and nothing fails it. IMPROVEMENTS §9.

### Recorded conflicts (not resolved here)

1. **Closed-label attribution vs. SG §2.5.** SG calls strict-label oracles brittle and
   grades diagnosis with a 9-question LLM checklist (κ = 0.90 vs a human). `DECISIONS.md`
   D12 forbids an LLM in the grading path; the house mitigation is a published closed
   vocabulary (B2/E2) and an *advisory* report judge (`tools/report_judge.py`,
   `report_assessment.advisory: true`).
2. **Binary reward vs. per-dimension partial credit.** SG and DG both report per-dimension
   or per-stage outcomes (SG keeps E2E as the headline; DG rejects partial credit for
   pipelines because "partial solutions have no value", §3.5). Our reward is binary;
   `mechanism.score` and the v2 pack verdicts are telemetry only.
3. **v2 public requirements vs. trap secrecy** (B1).
4. **09-I1 advisory attribution vs. D3** (A2).
5. **Minimal operational repair (D14/D16) vs. AX's complexity floor** (≥100 LoC, ≥3 files,
   §4.1) — a different task shape, not a defect; noted so nobody imports AX's filter.
