# Task-quality criteria — the evidence base behind the rubric

This is the long form: 33 criteria, each traced to the paper that argues for it, the
repo mechanism that enforces it (or the explicit gap), and a 0/1/2 scoring guide with
severity. It exists so every row of the short author-side sheet,
[`docs/TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md`](../TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md), can be checked back to a
source. Authors fill out the sheet; reviewers who want to know *why* a row exists come
here. Paper notes: [`2605.07161.md`](2605.07161.md) (SREGym), [`2601.20882.md`](2601.20882.md)
(DevOps-Gym), [`2601.08806.md`](2601.08806.md) (APEX-SWE).

Pipeline work the papers argue for that the repo does not do yet lives in
[`docs/archive/TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md`](../archive/TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md); this file is a
reference, not a work plan.

# Group A — Fault design

### A1. Fault, not symptom · **blocking**
**Def.** The injected thing is a real system mutation with a real repair, not a
running injector whose only cure is switching it off.
**Papers.** SREGym §2 DP2 (explicit rejection of chaos-tool symptom injection).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` Closed, code-owned fault tiers:
`substrates/frappe/checks/fault_validators.py::validate_config_tier` (four
`erpnext.*` families) and `::validate_runtime_tier` (five allowlisted MariaDB
globals); Tier-2 routes through `validate_image_tier` against a registered
`checks/dormant_faults.yaml` entry (D16). No chaos-tool path exists in the
substrate — the anti-pattern is structurally unavailable.
**Existing rubric.** Partly `real_fix_not_bandaid` `[ADV]`; the tier validators are NEW.
**0** repair is "stop the thing doing it". **1** a real mutation but the repair is
a restart/redeploy. **2** a named, allowlisted mutation with a named, durable
operational repair.

### A2. Ecological validity with recorded provenance · **should-fix**
**Def.** The incident actually happens to systems of this shape, and the reviewer
can see *why the author believes that*.
**Papers.** DevOps-Gym §3.1 (taxonomy from 1,000+ surveyed issues); APEX §2.2
(Issue–PR pairs, 350+ stars, ≥100 LoC across ≥3 files); SREGym §1.
**Repo mechanism.** `[ADV]` `realistic_incident`. `[MANUAL]` the REVIEWER.md
convention. `[GAP]` no provenance field exists — no `spec.yaml` slot for a cited
post-mortem or upstream issue, and nothing checks one. See IMPROVEMENTS.
**Existing rubric.** `realistic_incident` `[ADV]`.
**0** contrived. **1** plausible but asserted without a trace. **2** host-side
notes carry a mechanism trace to real upstream source (vendored code read,
upstream chart behaviour confirmed, or a cited incident).

### A3. Emergent under load, not statically present · **should-fix**
**Def.** The symptom develops — accumulates, crosses a threshold, or survives
removal of its trigger — rather than being true at t=0.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.4 (metastable: degrades on a transient event, "fails to
recover after the trigger is removed"); DevOps-Gym §3.3 (5–15 min manifestation).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` for the measurement: `dwell_cycles` / `soak_cycles`,
the peak/trough schedule in `loadgen-common/loadgen/schedule.py`, and D3's rule
that dwell is sized per fault to its recurrence period. `[ADV]` for the label:
`temporal_emergence` is passthrough metadata (`generate_tasks.py:294`) the oracle
never reads; only `metadata_truthful` challenges it.
**Existing rubric.** `difficult`, `metadata_truthful` — both `[ADV]`.
**0** symptom present at baseline. **1** load-dependent manifestation of a
constant fault. **2** genuine accumulation or metastability.

### A4. Causal distance is real · **should-fix**
**Def.** The graded root component is genuinely 2+ hops upstream of the
symptom-emitting service, on an observable path.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.5 Table 6 D1-Q2 (diagnosis must "distinguish the fault
origin from any secondary or cascading failure points"). D1 in this repo makes
causal-distance grading the lead novelty claim.
**Repo mechanism.** `[GAP]` — `causal_distance` is inert metadata the oracle never
reads (`substrates/slack-spine/design/cross-tier-fault-program.md:6` states this
outright). The proxy that does real work is the closed `component_registry`:
registering the symptom site as a distractor makes "blame where it hurts" a
gradeable failure. Nothing scores *distance*. See IMPROVEMENTS.
**Existing rubric.** `difficult`, `metadata_truthful` — both `[ADV]`.
**0** cause and symptom are the same component, or the declared distance is
fictional. **1** one real hop, but the shortest diagnostic path still lands on the
answer. **2** ≥2 hops, symptom site registered as a distractor, shortest obvious
path lands somewhere wrong.

### A5. Failure-mode complexity · **nice-to-have**
**Def.** Beyond simple saturation: metastable, concurrent, correlated, or a
qualitatively different mode such as silent data loss.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.4 (three compound modes); §3.2 (no agent solved a
metastable problem's second interacting component).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` partial — `ground_truth_set` (REQUIRE-BOTH answers) is
supported by `check_task_consistency.py::_answer_entries`, used by `06-F2c`.
`[GAP]` no fault *composition* API; a `fault:` block injects exactly one thing.
SREGym's composability principle is unimplemented here.
**Existing rubric.** NEW.
**0** single saturation fault. **1** single fault, non-obvious mode (silent drop,
account-scoped refusal, victim spread). **2** compound: two injectors, or a
metastable loop surviving trigger removal.

### A6. Ambient noise floor · **nice-to-have** *(today — see note)*
**Def.** Transient, self-recovering, non-causal disturbances coexist with the
fault, so the first anomalous line is not the answer.
**Papers.** SREGym §2 DP1 + §2.4 (noise defined as non-causal and
self-recovering) + §3 ("done by the framework, not hardcoded in any problems") +
§3.1 Table 3 (noise costs every agent/model pair 5–10 points); APEX §2.2 (10–20
symptom lines in 500–1,000 normal — 1–4% density).
**Repo mechanism.** Substrate-dependent. slack-spine: `py/pykit/noise.py` and
`app/noise.py` ship a seeded (seed=7) baseline log-noise floor whose docstring
states the criterion ("A sterile log makes the first anomalous line the answer");
traffic noise exists as opt-in `rate_jitter`/`noise_seed` in
`loadgen-common/loadgen/schedule.py`, enabled on two profiles only. **`[GAP]` on
Frappe** — no noise module, and the `dev` base profile that `frappe_dev`,
`frappe_db` and `frappe_read` all inherit sets no `rate_jitter`.
**Severity note.** Rated nice-to-have *only because the Frappe substrate offers no
mechanism* — it would be unfair to gate an author on infrastructure that does not
exist. Re-rate to should-fix the moment a noise floor lands. See IMPROVEMENTS.
**Existing rubric.** NEW.
**0** sterile baseline. **1** scenario-authored texture. **2** framework-generated,
seeded, on by default for every scenario on the substrate.

# Group B — Observability & realism

### B1. Real, standardized observability stack · **blocking**
**Def.** One instrumented telemetry surface held constant across scenarios, over a
real backend — not files on a volume, not frozen fixtures.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.3 (Prometheus/Loki/Jaeger MCP, one uniform stack);
DevOps-Gym §3.3 (must be detectable with the provided toolset).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` D10 — real Prometheus + Loki behind a thin obs-MCP
wrapper, held constant per substrate; `tools/test_obs_mcp_server.py`;
`substrates/<sub>/contracts/metrics.yaml` is the closed export set. Jaeger
deliberately deferred (single service, no traces).
**Existing rubric.** `agentic_diagnosis` `[ADV]`.
**0** files on a volume / mocked outputs. **1** real backend, scenario-specific
wiring. **2** the shared substrate stack, unchanged.

### B2. Telemetry does not hand over the answer · **should-fix**
**Def.** The published metric surface must not name the root cause; the diagnosis
must be earned from contrast, correlation, or logs.
**Papers.** APEX §2.2 (1–4% symptom density); SREGym §2.5 D2-Q2 (mutated details
must be discoverable, not handed over); LESSONS.md ("Treat this as a difficulty
dial").
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` `tools/lint_scenario.py::_scan_obs_metric_surface`
scans the agent-enumerable metric surface (exporter query keys, column names,
`description:` HELP strings — deliberately *not* the raw SQL, which is
unreachable) for root-cause tokens and fails loudly; motivated by the 2026-06-16
incident where `pg_wraparound_age.xids_until_stop` was enumerable verbatim through
`list_metrics()`. `[DET]` the closed `contracts/metrics.yaml` bounds what exists.
`[ADV]` `symptom_not_fix_instruction`, `semantic_answer_key_nonleak`.
**Severity note.** The single strongest determinant of task difficulty in this
repo. Treat 0 as blocking for anything claiming `eval_ready`.
**Existing rubric.** `symptom_not_fix_instruction` `[ADV]` + the lint.
**0** a single exported gauge *is* the answer. **1** the right family is exported
and one comparison lands on it. **2** the published comparison reads healthy or
points elsewhere; the agent must leave the metric surface.

### B3. Distractor density and decoy plausibility · **should-fix**
**Def.** Several plausible wrong answers are reachable, each with a discoverable
tell; the correct one is not a greppable singleton.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.5 (failure scope — "avoid over- or under-attributing
impact" presupposes over-attributable bystanders); APEX §2.2 (unstructured
chat/ticket context, much of it irrelevant).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` the closed `component_registry`; membership of the
answer pair and of every `minimality.allowed_keys_by_component` key is enforced by
`check_task_consistency.py` checks (1) and (2). The D7-motivated design rule —
every role exposes a similar `db-conn`/`handler`/`config` taxonomy "so the faulted
knob is not a greppable outlier" — is convention, carried in the answer keys.
`[MANUAL]` the decoy-map table in REVIEWER.md. `[ADV]` `decoy_plausibility`.
**Existing rubric.** `decoy_plausibility` `[ADV]`.
**0** the answer is the only component of its kind. **1** decoys exist
structurally, no documented tell. **2** ≥4 decoys with a written "why it's
tempting / why it's wrong / discoverable tell" table.

### B4. Agent-interface neutrality · **blocking**
**Def.** Grading does not couple to an agent architecture, tool-call pattern, or
trajectory shape.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.3 fn2 ("no assumption on the architectures or interaction
patterns of evaluated agents, to avoid brittle coupling").
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` D6.2/D6.4 — attribution goes through an agent-neutral
`submit_incident_report(service, component, mechanism, evidence_refs)` whose
schema forbids enumerations; trajectory inspection is explicitly "a reported
research metric, never a gate". D12 removed the LLM mechanism judge entirely.
**Existing rubric.** `outcome_verified`, `functional_verification` — `[ADV]` as
written, though the property is structurally guaranteed.
**0** grading reads the trajectory. **1** neutral, but a prescribed tool sequence
is required. **2** end-state only, through a neutral submission tool.

---

# Group C — Grading & oracle

### C1. Deterministic programmatic oracle · **blocking**
**Def.** Same trajectory ⇒ same verdict, computed from measured signals.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.1 ("programmatic verification whenever possible for reliable
evaluation"); DevOps-Gym App. C (execution-based).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` D12 removed the LLM from the grading path.
`tools/verifier_v2/contract.py` is a strict parser: unknown keys rejected,
`assert.op` from a closed set, and — load-bearing — the public `expected` is
*derived from* the executable assertion and is "deliberately not authorable:
accepting two independent values lets a task claim one public expectation while
grading another". `report_assessment.judge_required` must be `false`.
**Existing rubric.** `verifiable` `[ADV]`; the contract parser is a `[DET]` backstop.
**0** a judge can flip the verdict. **1** deterministic with a judge in an advisory
slot. **2** deterministic, `judge_required: false`, verifier-v2 contract.

### C2. Single end-to-end verdict, ANDed · **blocking**
**Def.** Detection/localization/RCA/mitigation are not scored independently; the
headline is a conjunction.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.3 fn2 (AIOpsLab "scores them independently, but real-world
failure handling is a single end-to-end loop").
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` D3/D6 dual gate; D6.6 scoring map ("headline =
conjunction — kills the D3 double-counting risk"). In verifier-v2,
`safe_repair.require` is a pack conjunction and `contract.py` rejects a contract
that requires nothing or leaves a pack unreferenced.
**Existing rubric.** `sound_dual_gate` `[ADV]`; the pack conjunction is `[DET]`.
**0** partial credit across stages. **1** conjunction, but one gate is inert.
**2** every declared gate is load-bearing and ANDed.

### C3. Durable repair under sustained load · **blocking**
**Def.** The oracle proves the system recovered *and stayed* recovered, not that a
value was written once.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.5 (the mitigation oracle checks both "the target fault is
resolved" and "the target system has recovered to a healthy state").
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` D6.5 frozen soak; `soak_cycles`;
`mariadb_state.required_phases: [baseline, declaration, soak_end]` with
`stable_probes` comparing declaration vs soak_end; the `db_setting_persistence`
and `runtime_persistence` packs; `repair_scope`'s `post_declaration_drift`. D23
makes declaration a terminal, agent-free boundary enforced by a root
`agent-freezer`, so the soak measures the system, not the agent.
**Existing rubric.** `outcome_verified` `[ADV]`; the phase machinery is `[DET]`.
**0** point-in-time check. **1** soak window with outcome bands only. **2** soak
window *plus* state probes proving the repaired value and unrelated invariants held.

### C4. Client-measured, tamper-resistant evidence · **blocking**
**Def.** The authoritative signal is measured outside the system under repair and
lives where the agent cannot reach it.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.5 (mitigation verified with "client-side and system-side
observability"); §2.1 (oracles held separately from agent execution).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` — the repo's strongest suit. LESSONS.md states the
rule: an agent "can edit the app to fake its `/metrics` … but cannot fake
client-measured signals without actually serving the load. Observability backend
and grading backend are separate on purpose." Enforced by loadgen-measured
latency/goodput/error-rate written only to the private `grader` volume; D23's
freezer capability Secret mounted only into loadgen/freezer/root-verifier;
root-only `tests/test.sh`; the grader broker (#224); `leak_probe`'s
`surface-exec-grader-isolation` invariant.
**Existing rubric.** `answer_key_isolation` `[ADV]`; the isolation is `[DET]`.
**0** grader reads a signal the agent can write. **1** separated by convention or
timing. **2** separate volume + credential + process boundary, with a probe
asserting it.

### C5. Oracle non-brittleness — an owned tradeoff · **should-fix**
**Def.** The oracle must not fail a correct diagnosis on a naming technicality.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.5 rejects exact-label matching outright — predefined labels
are "brittle because … often ambiguous and not mutually exclusive" — replacing it
with a 9-question checklist judge at κ=0.90 vs human. DevOps-Gym §3.3 goes the
other way (binary match against ground truth).
**Repo mechanism.** This repo takes DevOps-Gym's side *by decision* (D12: no LLM
in the grading path) and so inherits exactly the brittleness SREGym names. The
mitigations are real and `[DET]`: a *closed* `component_registry` published to the
agent (D6.2); `report_vocabulary: true`, which publishes exact spellings without
the pairing and which AUTHORING-FRAPPE §5 calls mandatory when the canonical token
differs from anything visible in the cluster; `check_task_consistency.py` check
(1) forcing the answer pair into its own registry;
`verifier/oracle/attribution.py::_canon_token` normalizing casefold + leading
`svc-` only. The residual risk is documented and has fired twice: `_canon_token`
"never rewrites hyphen to underscore", and LESSONS.md records both `solve.sh` and
`instruction.md` shipping a stale spelling — "and calibration cannot catch it,
because golden and nop both hardcode the same spelling." Only defence is
AUTHORING-FRAPPE §10's manual token grep. `[MANUAL]`.
**Existing rubric.** `functional_verification` `[ADV]` (which claims grading is
"set-based … not brittle string-matching" — arguably overclaims).
**0** open-vocabulary exact match, no published vocabulary. **1** closed registry
+ `report_vocabulary: true`. **2** the above *plus* recorded evidence the
emitted-token grep was run. **No scenario in this repo currently scores 2.**

### C6. Requirement traceability and honest disclosure · **should-fix**
**Def.** Every graded dimension traces to something the instruction asked, and the
public statement of an expectation cannot diverge from what is graded.
**Papers.** APEX §2.1 stage 1 ("task prompts align with the source documents
provided to the model"); §3.3 (rubric criteria are authored artifacts).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]`, verifier-v2 only: `public_requirements` is a
non-empty id/text list; every check carries `requirement_ids` validated against
it; `contract.py` derives the public `expected` rather than accepting one. Two
anti-laundering rules: an outcome check may not observe
`derived/legacy-outcome.json#/pass` (it "includes legacy restart policy"), and
service health must observe `/checks/services_up/value/all_running` not `/pass`,
so an undisclosed restart policy "cannot manufacture or suppress reward". Every
selected materializer must be consumed by a hard check, and
`repair_scope`/`retry_amplification` through semantic evidence rather than their
structural `/pass`. `[ADV]` `test_instruction_alignment`.
**Severity note.** should-fix rather than blocking only because v1 tasks exist and
grade correctly. Any *new* scenario should be v2.
**Existing rubric.** `test_instruction_alignment` `[ADV]`; the contract rules are NEW.
**0** v1 contract, no public requirements. **1** v2 with requirements but a coarse
or undisclosed check. **2** v2, every check requirement-linked, no `/pass` laundering.

### C7. Golden solution passes its own oracle · **blocking**
**Def.** A human-executable golden trajectory exists and earns reward 1 under
*this* task's gates.
**Papers.** APEX §2.1 stage 3 ("create a gold standard output, checking that the
human-authored solution passes all tests"); DevOps-Gym App. C.1 (fail-to-pass).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` `tools/calibrate.py` runs N golden trials through the
real `oracle.evaluate.evaluate_run` and stamps `calibration.golden_pass`.
`[DET]` `check_task_consistency.py` check (2): `golden_fix` keys must fall inside
the minimality allow-list *for the answer component(s)* — otherwise "the golden
trajectory would fail its own minimality gate". It deliberately does not union
across components, so a key allowed only under a decoy still fails. `[ADV]`
`solvable`.
**0** solve.sh unexecuted. **1** statically consistent, never run. **2** N≥3
golden PASS recorded in `calibration.golden_pass`.

---

# Group D — Anti-shortcut & leak resistance

### D1. In-band answer-key leak · **blocking**
**Def.** No agent-readable artifact names the fault, the golden value, the oracle,
or the benchmark framing.
**Papers.** DevOps-Gym §3.1/App. B (git metadata stripped so the fix cannot be read
from history); APEX §2.1 stage 2. D7 is this repo's incident record.
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` `tools/lint_scenario.py`, wired into
`validate.sh lint` + smoke + CI. Two check classes over the substrate's declared
`lint.agent_visible` surface: scenario-agnostic framing keywords (`fault`,
`golden`, `oracle`, `injected`, `ground.?truth`, …) and per-scenario literals from
*every* ground-truth.yaml — the `golden_fix` and `injected` values, matched only
when co-occurring with their own knob name, plus the fault component id. Plus
`_scan_exposed_src` over the `layer/` source of `shell-visible`/`build-capable`
scenarios. LESSONS.md: "Nobody lints agent-visible artifacts for leaks; every peer
relies on author hygiene."
**Known hole `[GAP]`.** The literal set is built from `fault.golden_fix` and
`fault.injected`, both empty by design for a **runtime-tier** fault ("vacuous /
runtime-event fix"), so such a scenario's faulted and repaired values are never
linted. They live in `mariadb_state.probes.*.expect`, which `_scenario_literals`
does not read. See IMPROVEMENTS.
**Existing rubric.** Out of scope in the toml header (already `[DET]`);
`semantic_answer_key_nonleak` `[ADV]` covers paraphrase.
**0** lint not run, or hits present. **1** lint clean but the scenario's values are
outside the lint's reach (any runtime-tier task today). **2** lint clean *and* the
scenario's own literals are inside the linted set.

### D2. The trap is mechanical **and has been exercised** · **should-fix**
**Def.** The plausible-wrong repair — the one a good agent tries first — is
gradeable as failing, and someone has actually run it through the evaluator.
**Papers.** APEX §2.1 stage 2 (test suites audited for reward-hacking
susceptibility); §2.1 (credentials-from-env makes the shortcut gradeable as
wrong); SREGym §4 (prior work "lack[s] protection against reward hacking").
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` three complementary fences:
config-tier — `minimality.allowed_keys_by_component` + `max_unrelated_mutations:
0` over the config diff (D6.3, the fix that closed the shotgun-overprovision
hole); runtime-tier — `mariadb_state` computes `mutated = {probe | baseline ≠
declaration}` then `unexpected = mutated − allowed_mutations`, so declaring the
decoy knob as a **probe** while omitting it from `allowed_mutations` turns a
merely-unhelpful action into a hard `mutation_scope` failure (AUTHORING-FRAPPE
§3); attribution — the `canonical_report_component` check, so a correct repair
with a wrong diagnosis still fails.
**The `[MANUAL]` half is the gap.** LESSONS.md: "A trap documented in prose is not
a trap. … Until the wrong repair is actually run and actually fails, the
scenario's central claim is unverified." AUTHORING-FRAPPE §10 makes exercising the
decoy a pre-push step, but nothing runs it, and the FP=FN=0 fence cannot
substitute — it exercises golden and nop only. See IMPROVEMENTS.
**Existing rubric.** `anti_cheat_robustness`, `minimality_calibrated` — both `[ADV]`.
**0** prose only, or no decoy repair exists. **1** mechanically declared
(probe-minus-allowlist, or excluded from `allowed_keys`) but never executed.
**2** the wrong repair has been run through the real evaluator and recorded FAILing.

### D3. Symptom suppression and band-aids are blocked · **blocking**
**Def.** Throttling, caching, scaling away offered work, restarting, or enlarging
the wrong resource must not pass.
**Papers.** SREGym §2 DP2 + §2.5; APEX §4.2 (open-loop execution — "assuming that
code generation is equivalent to task completion").
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` D6.1 replaced the generator-liveness invariant with
`goodput ≥ (1−tol) × offered RPS` precisely because "a server-side throttle/cache
defeats" liveness, and added a saturation-signal check so "slow but completing"
still fails. Plus restart-legitimacy in the legacy outcome, the `repair_scope`
materializer's `changed_keys` / `post_declaration_drift`, and the soak-window
re-collapse check.
**Existing rubric.** `real_fix_not_bandaid` `[ADV]`.
**0** only "is it healthy now". **1** goodput-vs-offered. **2** goodput plus a
scope/persistence gate catching the specific band-aid this fault invites.

### D4. Grading isolation · **blocking**
**Def.** Answer key, evidence, and verdict are unreachable and unforgeable from the
agent's process.
**Papers.** SREGym §2.1 (oracles held separately); LESSONS.md's peer spectrum
places SREGym and Harbor-SEPARATE at the strong end.
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` D9 + D23: root-only `tests/test.sh`; `tests/oracle/`
unreadable by the agent; the freezer capability Secret mounted only into loadgen,
freezer and the root verifier view; a forced kill counted as evidence rather than
infra failure; a post-freeze snapshot that must match the submission snapshot or
the run fails closed. Named-exec (D20) `resourceNames`-scopes `pods/exec` so an
exec grant cannot reach the loadgen grader, with `leak_probe` failing loudly if it
can.
**Existing rubric.** `answer_key_isolation` `[ADV]`.
**0** same process/volume. **1** separated by convention. **2** the D23 freeze +
snapshot-equality receipt.

### D5. Training-data contamination resistance · **nice-to-have**
**Def.** The task is not solvable from memorization of public artifacts, and this
has been probed.
**Papers.** DevOps-Gym §3.1 + App. B (prefix-completion probing; five metrics with
thresholds; repo exclusion at C ≥ 0.2; git metadata stripped); APEX §6 (200
leaderboard / 50 open dev split).
**Repo mechanism.** `[GAP]` — nothing. DECISIONS.md lists "Q17 — contamination
model (private split + rotation cadence)" under *Still open*. Distinct from D1: D1
is strong and covers *in-band* leakage; D5 covers *pre-training* leakage. The
partial mitigant is incidental — faults are injected into a vendored upstream
chart at author-chosen knobs, so there is no public issue/PR pair to memorize —
but that is a property of the injection model, not a control. See IMPROVEMENTS.
**Severity note.** nice-to-have because no mechanism exists to score against; this
is an open decision (Q17), not an oversight.
**Existing rubric.** NEW.
**0** no consideration. **1** argued (fault has no public counterpart) but
unprobed. **2** probed, or held out of the public split.

### D6. Instruction hint discipline · **should-fix**
**Def.** The prompt frames the symptom in on-call language and does not enumerate
the diagnostic path, the metric family, or the remedy.
**Papers.** APEX §4.1 (successful agents "parse unstructured descriptions into
lists of hard constraints" — the constraints should be buried, not listed);
LESSONS.md ("The observability instruction can itself leak or help … Treat this as
a difficulty dial").
**Repo mechanism.** `[ADV]` only — `symptom_not_fix_instruction`,
`natural_oncall_voice`, `essential_difficulty`. `[DET]` partial:
`check_task_consistency.py` check (4) is explicitly WARN-only because "instruction
STYLE varies legitimately", and `lint_scenario.py` deliberately does not scan
`instruction.md` ("curated agent-facing prose"). The highest-leverage difficulty
dial in the repo is ungated by construction.
**Existing rubric.** `symptom_not_fix_instruction` `[ADV]`.
**0** names the metric or the knob. **1** names the tool surface and the metric
families. **2** symptom-only; points at `submit_incident_report --help` for
vocabulary and `list_metrics()` for discovery.

# Group E — Calibration, discrimination & reproducibility

### E1. Discrimination fence (FP = FN = 0) · **blocking**
**Def.** Every golden run passes and every no-op run fails, under the real oracle.
**Papers.** DevOps-Gym App. C.1/C.2 (fail-to-pass *and* no-false-positive);
SREGym §3.3 Table 5 (discriminative validity demonstrated).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` `tools/calibrate.py`: N golden + M nop trials re-graded
with "the SAME `evaluate_run` the verifier uses (NOT an approximate
re-implementation)", reporting golden-PASS = 1−FP and nop-FAIL = 1−FN.
`calibrate --write` refuses to stamp unless the fence passes: "the
harness-suggested bands do NOT achieve FP=FN=0 … the committed spec is left
UNCHANGED." Evidence lands in `calibration.golden_pass` / `nop_fail` /
`workflow_run_id` and flips `thresholds.provisional: false`.
**Scope limit.** Proves the fault fires and the golden fix works. Says nothing
about whether a plausible-wrong repair fails (D2), and LESSONS.md notes it is
blind to shared-spelling bugs because golden and nop hardcode the same spelling.
**Existing rubric.** Out of scope in the toml header (already `[DET]`);
`calibration_honesty` `[ADV]` covers the claim.
**0** never run. **1** run, or run at N<3, or `provisional: true`. **2** ≥3/3
golden PASS and ≥3/3 nop FAIL, `provisional: false`, stamped.

### E2. Effect size clears noise, and is published · **should-fix**
**Def.** The margin between golden and nop on the load-bearing signal is large
relative to run-to-run variance, and the numbers are written down.
**Papers.** DevOps-Gym §4.3 (run-to-run sd 2.40 / 2.04 reported as evidence);
SREGym §3.1 Table 3 (noise moves results 5–10 points, so bands must tolerate it).
Also archive/QUESTIONS.md Q18: an "effect-size-must-clear-noise hard gate" was a
Phase-0 exit criterion.
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` partial — `calibrate.py` prints the per-phase measured
golden-vs-nop spread and applies `BAND_MIN_FRACTION` / `BAND_STDEV_MULT = 3.0` /
`BAND_MIN_LATENCY_MS = 100` when suggesting bands, with the policy note that
generic health guardrails "are never tightened merely to separate nop captures".
`[GAP]` there is no minimum-margin gate and the measured spread is never persisted
into the manifest. See IMPROVEMENTS.
**Existing rubric.** `calibration_honesty` `[ADV]`.
**0** bands guessed or copied from another scenario. **1** measured, or published
but thin. **2** measured, published in host-side notes, with a margin the author
argues clears trial noise.

### E3. Environment determinism and pinning · **blocking**
**Def.** Same task + same agent behaviour ⇒ same environment, run to run.
**Papers.** DevOps-Gym §4.1 ("isolated and reproducible Docker container
environments"); SREGym §3 (three runs per problem).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` seeded load schedule (`dev` profile `seed: 42`, with a
separate `noise_seed` stream so enabling jitter "never moves the underlying
arrival stream"); digest-pinned images; `tools/check_task_identity.py` asserting
task chart == substrate chart byte-identity; `generate_tasks.py --check`;
ephemeral kind/k3s cluster per trial. `[ADV]` `deterministic_reproducible`.
**0** floating tags or an external service dependency. **1** pinned but unseeded.
**2** pinned, seeded, byte-identity-checked.

### E4. Calibration currency (staleness is detectable) · **should-fix**
**Def.** A stamped calibration is invalidated when anything it was measured
against moves.
**Papers.** No direct analogue — repo-native, and genuinely additive relative to
all three papers, none of which addresses calibration decay.
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` a six-fingerprint set stamped into `calibration:`:
`base_fingerprint`, `layer_fingerprint`, `profile_fingerprint`,
`grader_fingerprint`, `calibration_surface_fingerprint`,
`qualification_surface_fingerprint`, plus `source_sha` / `workflow_run_id` /
`artifact_name` / `calibrated_at`. LESSONS.md documents the deliberate divergence:
`substrate.base_fingerprint` applies `_FP_EXCLUDE_DIRS` while
`task_dev/core.py::_tree_hash` hashes everything under `build_inputs`, so a
`checks/`-only edit moves the qualification surface without being classified as
affecting a task (commit 688624176 says so explicitly).
**Known state.** AUTHORING-FRAPPE §11 — `hosted_ready` is `false` for every task on
both substrates because `calibration.health_version` has never been stamped.
**Existing rubric.** `calibration_honesty` `[ADV]`.
**0** no calibration block. **1** bands present, fingerprints partial or stale.
**2** full fingerprint set matching current HEAD.

### E5. Repeats and variance reporting · **should-fix**
**Def.** Enough trials to distinguish a real effect from a flake, and the spread
reported.
**Papers.** SREGym §3 ("three runs per problem"); DevOps-Gym §4.3.
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` partial — calibration defaults to N=3 golden + M=3 nop.
`[GAP]` no per-scenario run-to-run variance statistic is committed anywhere, and
there is no repeats requirement for *evaluation* trials as distinct from
calibration trials.
**Existing rubric.** NEW.
**0** N=1 or none. **1** N=3 calibration trials. **2** N≥3 plus a recorded spread a
reviewer can read.

### E6. Human / expert baseline · **nice-to-have**
**Def.** A human expert's performance anchors the difficulty claim.
**Papers.** DevOps-Gym §3.3 (three senior DevOps engineers independently validate
detectability) and §3.1 (10+ expert-hours per task); APEX §2.1/§2.2 (3+ years'
experience authors; gold standard solution).
**Repo mechanism.** `[GAP]`, deliberately. `docs/archive/QUESTIONS.md:155`:
"(Human-baseline question deferred — consistent with leaderboard audience;
relative rankings + difficulty calibration need no human anchor.)" The nearest
substitutes are the golden `solve.sh` (an *existence* proof, not a *difficulty*
measure) and ad-hoc real-agent trials recorded in REVIEWER.md.
**Existing rubric.** NEW.
**0** no evidence any non-author can solve it. **1** a real-agent trial recorded
with outcome and behaviour. **2** a human or independent-agent baseline with a
time/attempt figure.

# Group F — Authoring integrity & traceability

### F1. Reviewer-verifiable notes · **should-fix**
**Def.** A non-author can verify the decoy map, the calibration and the trap
without re-deriving the scenario.
**Papers.** DevOps-Gym §3.3 (independent validation by three engineers presupposes
a reviewable artifact); APEX §2.1 (three-stage validation).
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]`-warn: `check_task_consistency.py` check (5) warns when
no non-empty `REVIEWER.md` / `NOTES.md` / `DESIGN.md` exists — "expected for
eval-ready tasks" — but it is a WARN, never a hard failure. `[ADV]`
`reviewer_context_quality`.
**Existing rubric.** `reviewer_context_quality` `[ADV]`.
**0** absent. **1** present but thin (fault description only). **2** decoy map with
tells + calibration provenance + intended traps + open questions.

### F2. Single source of truth for every graded token · **should-fix**
**Def.** Each graded value and identifier has one canonical home; all other
occurrences are generated or provably identical.
**Papers.** No direct analogue; APEX §4.2's "specification hallucination" is the
agent-side mirror of the same failure.
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` partial — `check_task_consistency.py` forces the answer
pair into its registry and `golden_fix ⊆` the answer components' allow-list;
`generate_tasks.py --check` keeps task and spec in sync; `check_task_identity.py`
enforces chart byte-identity; `contract.py` derives `expected`.
**`[GAP]` for the case that actually bit.** Nothing greps `solve.sh` and
`instruction.md` for the emitted service/component spelling against the
`ground_truth` pair. LESSONS.md records this class firing twice in one session and
notes calibration is structurally blind to it; AUTHORING-FRAPPE §4 and §10 make it
a manual pre-push step. See IMPROVEMENTS.
**Existing rubric.** `single_source_of_truth`, `typos` — both `[ADV]`.
**0** duplicated values that can drift silently. **1** duplication covered by the
existing set checks. **2** the emitted-token grep run and recorded.

### F3. Admission cost / base-surface blast radius · **should-fix**
**Def.** Adding the scenario does not invalidate other scenarios' evidence or force
a release cycle.
**Papers.** SREGym §2 DP3/DP4 (composability + extensibility as first-class
quality; prior work is "hard to extend due to their bespoke designs").
**Repo mechanism.** `[DET]` `tools/task_dev/core.py::classify()` returns
`base_release_substrates`; a non-empty value makes `task-qualification`'s
`base_release` engine demand a trusted base-release receipt bound to *your* PR
number. AUTHORING-FRAPPE §7 gives the cheap envelope (`scenarios/` + `tasks/` +
`contracts/registry.yaml`) and the pre-push check that must print `[]`. Adding a
`loadgen_*/profiles.yaml` profile is inside `base_fingerprint`, so it invalidates
the calibration of *every* task on that substrate.
**Existing rubric.** NEW.
**0** touches a base surface with no release budgeted. **1** touches a base surface
with the release budgeted and stated in REVIEWER.md. **2** confined to
`scenarios/` + `tasks/` + `contracts/registry.yaml`.

### F4. Empirical verification ladder · **nice-to-have**
**Def.** The author recorded which claims about the fault were empirically
verified, and how.
**Papers.** DevOps-Gym §3.1/§3.2 (10+ expert-hours; ~40% of candidates needed
multiple iterations before reproducing) — the pipeline's rigour is that paper's
main quality argument, and it is legible only because it was written down.
**Repo mechanism.** `[MANUAL]` REVIEWER.md convention only; no schema, no gate.
The best instance in the repo is 03-QE1's "Empirical verification ladder (all
VERIFIED)" with five labelled assertions plus a five-item bug ladder.
**Existing rubric.** `authoring_integrity` `[ADV]`.
**0** fault behaviour asserted. **1** key mechanism steps verified, recorded
informally. **2** a labelled ladder — fault renders → fault fires → repair works →
oracle consumes a discriminating signal — each with its evidence.

# Applying it: three Frappe scenarios

Scored 2026-08-19 against `scenarios/frappe/03-F1-connection-cap` (on `main`,
calibrated), `origin/feat/frappe-user-conn-cap:…/03-U1-user-conn-cap`, and
`origin/feat/frappe-03qe1-port:…/03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap`.

> **Note.** `03-F1-connection-cap` ships **no REVIEWER.md** — on `main` it has
> exactly `ground-truth.yaml`, `instruction.md`, `solve.sh`, `spec.yaml`. Both
> branch scenarios ship one.

| # | Criterion | Sev | F1 | U1 | QE1 | Justification (F1 / U1 / QE1) |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|
| A1 | Fault not symptom | B | 2 | 2 | 2 | Config-tier my.cnf key / runtime `SET GLOBAL` on an allowlisted global / config-tier redis `extraFlags`. |
| A2 | Ecological validity | S | 1 | 2 | 2 | Ubiquitous incident, no host-side notes / REVIEWER argues the "metric and logs disagree" on-call lesson and statically verifies no `MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS` grant / REVIEWER reads `frappe/utils/background_jobs.py` in the vendored image to prove `enqueue()` only catches `ConnectionError`. |
| A3 | Emergent under load | S | 1 | 1 | 2 | Cap constant from boot, concurrency crosses at peak / identical shape / RQ memory genuinely accumulates to 32 MB — the only real accumulation of the three. |
| A4 | Causal distance real | S | 1 | 2 | 2 | Declares 3, but `mysql_global_variables_max_connections` and `threads_connected` are both exported: one comparison *is* the answer / declares 4, published saturation comparison reads healthy by construction / declares 4; Desk latency normal, MariaDB quiet, redis-*cache* quiet. Ungraded in all three. |
| A5 | Failure-mode complexity | N | 0 | 1 | 1 | Plain saturation / account-scoped refusal while the aggregate looks healthy / silent job loss. No compound faults anywhere. |
| A6 | Ambient noise floor | N | 0 | 0 | 0 | Frappe ships no noise module; `frappe_db` / `frappe_dev_queue` inherit `dev`, which sets no `rate_jitter`. |
| B1 | Real obs stack | B | 2 | 2 | 2 | Shared Prometheus + Loki + obs-MCP, unmodified. |
| B2 | Telemetry doesn't hand it over | S | 0 | 2 | 1 | The exported `max_connections` vs `threads_connected` comparison resolves the fault / `max_user_connections` is **not exported at all** and the exported comparison points at an innocent knob / redis memory exported for both instances; agent must pick the right one and correlate enqueue-vs-processed. |
| B3 | Distractor density | S | 1 | 2 | 2 | Uniform 11-service taxonomy but no documented decoy map / 5-row decoy table with tells, registry deliberately carries both ceilings / 7-row decoy table plus a separate intended-traps section. |
| B4 | Interface neutrality | B | 2 | 2 | 2 | `submit_incident_report`; no trajectory grading. |
| C1 | Deterministic oracle | B | 2 | 2 | 2 | v2, `judge_required: false` / v2, no `report_assessment` block (contract defaults to enabled + not-required) / v1 dual-gate — deterministic either way. |
| C2 | End-to-end conjunction | B | 2 | 2 | 2 | Four required packs ANDed / four required packs ANDed / v1 dual gate + minimality. |
| C3 | Durable repair | B | 2 | 2 | 1 | Soak + `mariadb_state` soak_end predicates + `soak_persistence` + `repair_scope` drift / identical / soak window and outcome bands only — nothing proves the `CONFIG SET` survived, and there is no `repair_scope` materializer. |
| C4 | Client-measured evidence | B | 2 | 2 | 2 | Substrate-level loadgen/grader isolation. |
| C5 | Oracle non-brittleness | S | 1 | 1 | 1 | All three: closed registry + `report_vocabulary: true`, no recorded token grep. QE1 carries the sharpest hazard — canonical `redis_queue` vs DNS `svc-redis-queue`, registry knowingly mixing underscore and legacy hyphen ids. Nothing scores 2. |
| C6 | Requirement traceability | S | 2 | 2 | 0 | 5 public requirements, every check linked, no `/pass` laundering / same / **v1: no `verification:` block, no public requirements**. |
| C7 | Golden passes own oracle | **B** | 2 | **0** | 2 | 3/3 golden PASS (run 32027143586) / never run — `/calibrate` failed all six trials with `HealthcheckError` at cap=5, not re-run at 8 / 3/3 golden PASS (run 31747324181). |
| D1 | In-band leak lint | B | 2 | 1 | 2 | `injected: 10` / `golden_fix: 200` inside the lint's literal set / **runtime tier: both empty, so the faulted 8 and repair 0 are never linted** / `32mb` / `512mb` linted. |
| D2 | Trap mechanical **and exercised** | S | 0 | 1 | 1 | No trap — F1's answer *is* the reflex every later scenario traps / decoy mechanically fenced (`max_connections` a declared probe, absent from `allowed_mutations`) but never executed / `maxmemory-policy` excluded from `allowed_keys`, but its own REVIEWER says trial 3 "Does NOT yet tell us if the LRU-flip trap works". |
| D3 | Band-aids blocked | B | 2 | 2 | 1 | goodput-vs-offered + `repair_scope` + `mutation_scope` / same, plus the server-wide cap fenced / minimality + goodput only; "scale the workers" caught by attribution alone, no post-declaration drift fence. |
| D4 | Grading isolation | B | 2 | 2 | 2 | Substrate-level D23 freeze + private grader volume. |
| D5 | Contamination | N | 0 | 0 | 0 | No mechanism in the repo; no scenario argues it either. |
| D6 | Instruction hint discipline | S | 2 | 1 | 1 | 11 lines, symptom-only, points at `--help` / 17 lines but hands the *strategy* ("the connection dashboards … do not show the server approaching its limits"; "trust … the server"; "restore … to its documented server default") / 94 lines enumerating the stack, both admin surfaces, and the metric families including "Redis gauges, RQ queue depth". |
| E1 | FP=FN=0 fence | **B** | 2 | **0** | 2 | 3/3 + 3/3, `provisional: false` / never run; REVIEWER states it is currently *uncalibratable* (`write_back: false`, `qualification.automatic: false`) / 3/3 + 3/3, `provisional: false`. |
| E2 | Effect size published | S | 1 | 0 | 1 | Bands stamped, no per-signal spread recorded, and `mariadb_threads_p99_max` is by its own comment "DECLARED but NOT YET CONSUMED" / bands lifted verbatim from F1 as "a STARTING HYPOTHESIS … not a measurement of this scenario" / measurements published (oracle 278/2556 vs nop 59/2532), but the aggregate gate is inert by design and the verdict rests on an **0.09 absolute** error-rate margin at n=3. |
| E3 | Determinism & pinning | B | 2 | 2 | 2 | Shared seeded schedule, digest-pinned images, byte-identity check. |
| E4 | Calibration currency | S | 2 | 0 | 2 | Full six-fingerprint set + `source_sha` + run id / no `calibration:` block / full set. Both 2s conditional — see below. |
| E5 | Repeats & variance | S | 1 | 0 | 1 | N=3+3 / none / N=3+3. No committed variance statistic anywhere. |
| E6 | Human/expert baseline | N | 0 | 0 | 1 | None / none / two real-agent trials recorded (Opus-5 reward 0.0 at 17m34s, timed out mid-investigation; trial 4 OOM-killed and correctly discounted). |
| F1 | Reviewer notes | S | 0 | 2 | 2 | **No REVIEWER/NOTES/DESIGN at all** — trips `check_task_consistency`'s WARN / decoy map + trap mechanics + predicate rationale + three open questions / decoy map + traps + verification ladder + bug ladder + trial log. |
| F2 | Single source of truth | S | 1 | 1 | 1 | Set checks pass, no recorded token grep / same, plus a **two-surface drift defect** (`ground-truth.yaml:118` and `REVIEWER.md:65` both still say "the faulted 5" while `expect.baseline` is `{eq: 8}` — fixed on branch 2026-08-19) / same, plus a registry knowingly mixing canonical and legacy id forms. |
| F3 | Admission cost | S | 2 | 2 | 0 | Reuses `frappe_db` / reuses `frappe_db` / **adds `frappe_dev_queue` to `loadgen_frappe/profiles.yaml`** — inside `base_fingerprint`, so it demands a base-release receipt bound to its PR and invalidates every other Frappe task's calibration. |
| F4 | Verification ladder | N | 0 | 1 | 2 | None recorded / open questions + one static verification / labelled A4/A5/A6′/A7 ladder, each with evidence. |

### Blocking-severity gate

| | blocking rows at 0 | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **F1** | none | mergeable |
| **U1** | **C7, E1** | **not mergeable as eval-ready** — no golden run, no fence |
| **QE1** | none | mergeable |

The severity layer does the work the totals cannot: U1 ties F1 on raw score while
failing two blocking criteria. Read the blocking gate first, subtotals second,
totals never.

## What the rubric revealed

**The totals are nearly useless and the subtotals are not.** F1 and U1 tie at 42
by completely different routes: F1 banks Groups C and E (a finished, calibrated
verifier-v2 contract with nothing behind it), U1 banks A, B and F (the best
*designed* incident in the set with no evidence it runs). A flat sum of 33
criteria lets substrate-inherited items dilute the handful that separate them:
**twelve of the 33 rows are constant across all three scenarios** (A1, A6, B1, B4,
C1, C2, C4, C5, D4, D5, E3, F2) because they are properties of the Frappe
substrate, not of the scenario. Those belong in a substrate-level checklist run
once, not a per-scenario score run every time.

**Seven criteria do all the discriminating.** B2 `0/2/1` · C6 `2/2/0` · C7 `2/0/2`
· D2 `0/1/1` · E1 `2/0/2` · F1 `0/2/2` · F3 `2/2/0`. Score only those and you get
three genuinely different scenarios: **F1 validated but shallow**, **U1
well-designed but unproven**, **QE1 validated and deep but expensive**.

**The ranking QE1 > {F1, U1} is right, but for a reason the score hides.** QE1 is
the only scenario with a real accumulation mechanism (A3=2), a documented
verification ladder (F4=2), real agent trials (E6=1) *and* a passed fence. What
the score under-punishes is F3=0: `frappe_dev_queue` moves `base_fingerprint`
(confirmed by probe: `df93d2…` → `2b06bd72…`), so merging QE1 **invalidates F1's
stamped calibration** — currently F1's entire claim to being eval-ready. One
scenario's admission cost silently downgrades another's evidence, and no
single-scenario row can express that. Report the two facts together.

**Where the rubric is most likely wrong: E2.** QE1 scores 1 for publishing its
effect size, more than F1 does — but the published numbers show a 0.09 absolute
error-rate margin (oracle 0.891 vs nop 0.977) carrying the entire verdict at n=3,
while the aggregate bands (`error_rate_max: 0.35`, `goodput_min_ratio: 0.6`) are
too permissive to fail. As written, *publishing a thin margin scores the same as
measuring a wide one*. E2 needs a margin threshold, not a "was it measured" test.

**F1's rank is the second stress test, and the rubric survives it.** F1 is the only
one on `main`, the only one with `provisional: false` *and* a v2 contract, so a
calibration-weighted rubric would crown it. This one does not, because B2=0, D2=0,
F1=0 and F4=0 say what the calibration cannot: F1's answer is readable off an
exported metric comparison, it has no trap, and it ships no host-side notes for a
reviewer to check either claim. It is a correct, working, *easy* scenario — and
that both later scenarios are built specifically to punish "the 03-F1 reflex" is
the strongest available evidence those low scores are not an artifact.

**Two criteria nothing in the repo can currently score 2 on.** C5 (oracle
non-brittleness) and F2 (single source of truth) — both blocked on the same
missing token-grep gate, and LESSONS.md already records the class firing twice. A
criterion nothing can pass is either a bar worth building to or a bad criterion;
this is the former, and the fix is small. See `TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md`.
