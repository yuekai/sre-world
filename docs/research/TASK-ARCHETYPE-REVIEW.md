# Task archetypes in the SRE/DevOps agent-benchmark literature

What the three source papers report as *discriminative*, what they report as *saturating
or misleading*, what their grading designs do to make the difference, and which of it is
reachable on our substrates given the measured walls in
[`docs/KILL-LEDGER.md`](../KILL-LEDGER.md).

This is a review, not a plan. §5 proposes work; nothing here changes what an author must
do to ship a scenario.

Companion files: [`TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md`](TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md) (33 criteria traced
to paper sections), [`../TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md`](../TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md) (the scored
subset), [`../TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md`](../archive/TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md) (pipeline
gaps), [`../KILL-LEDGER.md`](../KILL-LEDGER.md) (our refuted candidates).

## 0. Sources and provenance

### 0.1 What was read

The repo carries **structured notes**, not PDFs
(`docs/research/2605.07161.md`, `2601.20882.md`, `2601.08806.md`). For this review the
primary sources were fetched directly on **2026-08-25**:

| short | paper | versions fetched | what was read |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SG** | SREGym, arXiv:2605.07161 | v1 (2026-05-08), v3 (2026-07-30) | full body + Appendices A–I |
| **DG** | DevOps-Gym, arXiv:2601.20882 | v1 only (no later version exists) | full body + Appendices A–D |
| **AX** | APEX-SWE, arXiv:2601.08806 | v1 (2026-01-13), v2 (2026-03-18), v3 (2026-03-23) | full body + appendix |

and the three benchmark repositories were cloned, read, and then deleted:

| repo | HEAD at read time | last commit |
|---|---|---|

Every claim below is tagged with the version or SHA it came from. Claims marked
**[measured]** were computed by this review against the clone at the SHA above and are
reproducible only against that commit; they are not in any paper. Claims marked
**[executed]** are results of running our own oracle code on this branch — the probes are
reproduced inline so a reviewer can re-run them. No paper text was copied into this repo.

### 0.2 Provenance corrections to our own documents

Reading the primary sources surfaced four citation defects in files this review depends
on. They are recorded here because two of them change the meaning of a rubric row.

1. **`docs/research/2601.08806.md` claims a v1 fetch but carries v3 numbers.** Its
   provenance note says `arxiv.org/html/2601.08806v1`. Its content — "Claude Opus 4.6
   leads at 40.5% Pass@1" — appears only in **v3**; v1's leader is Gemini 3 Pro at 25.0%
   over a different eight-model set with no Opus 4.6 in it. The same file's task-design
   claims (three-stage validation, 500–1,000/10–20 log density, 350-star + 100-LoC +
   3-file provenance filter) *are* present verbatim in v1 and survive to v3, so the
   qualitative content is sound; only the results-table provenance is wrong.
2. **The `24.1%` / `10.9%` pass-rate pair in that file is not reproducible from any
   version.** v1's per-task-type means are Integration 25.1% and Observability 10.5%
   (computed from Tables 1 and 5); v3's are higher again. Treat both numbers as
   unsourced.
3. **Our two docs cite two different versions of SG Table 5 without saying so.**
   `docs/research/2605.07161.md` gives P(M|¬D) as **35–59%** (v1, §3.3, verbatim). 
   `docs/TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` A2 gives it as **22–62%** (v3, §3.3, verbatim). Both are
   correct for their version. v3 also moves P(M|D) from 69–88% to 68–89%. The
   *qualitative* claim — diagnosis predicts mitigation — is stable across versions, and
   nothing in this review turns on which number is used, but the rubric's blanket
   "citations refer to the arXiv PDFs" should name a version.
4. **`docs/TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` B2's "Normal Cases (14.3% of monitoring tasks)" is not
   in the paper and does not match the shipped repo.** DG §3.3 states only that "we also
   include cases where the system operates without any anomalies"; it gives no
   proportion. **[measured]** the shipped set has 6 `*__none` tasks out of 34 = **17.6%**.
   The rubric's *argument* (agents false-positive on healthy systems, so healthy cases
   are a first-class shape) is fully supported by DG §4.2; only the figure is wrong.

### 0.3 Internal inconsistencies in the papers themselves

Worth knowing before citing DG precisely. **[measured]** counts are directories containing
a `task.yaml` under `tasks/<stage>/` at SHA `9bbe3f0d`:

| stage | paper §3.1 | shipped **[measured]** |
|---|---:|---:|
| build & configuration | 54 | 66 |
| monitoring | 34 (Fig. 1) / 30 (§3.3) | 34 |
| issue resolving | 310 | 308 |
| test generation | 310 | 308 |
| end-to-end pipeline | 18 (§3.1) / 14 (abstract, §1) / 14 rows (Table 4) | 17 |
| **total** | **704** | **733** |

Plus one label-count inconsistency: §3.1 enumerates six anomalies; §3.3 says the prompt
"define[s] the five anomaly types"; the shipped `task.yaml` instruction lists **seven**
pattern names (six anomalies plus `none`).

None of this is fatal — a repo moves on after a paper freezes — but it means DG's reported
monitoring rate cannot be reconciled to a specific task set with certainty, which is the
caveat §2.6 turns on.

## 1. Archetypes the papers report as discriminative

Ordered by the strength of the evidence, not by how attractive the archetype is.

### 1.1 Novel failure *mode*, not novel application — SG's strongest single result

SG §3.2, Table 4 (identical in v1 and v3):

| tier | n | Stratus+Sonnet E2E | Claude Code E2E | Codex E2E |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Ported from AIOpsLab/ITBench | 34 | 63.7% | 60.8% | 57.8% |
| Similar failure patterns, new app/component | 43 | 58.9% | **70.5%** | 61.2% |
| New failure modes unique to SG | 13 | **17.9%** | **28.2%** | **15.4%** |

The authors credit "significant gaps in AI agents' ability to address high-fidelity
failures such as those rooted in low-level stacks and/or caused by compound failures"
(§3.2).

The nuance the headline hides, and the one that matters for authoring: **the "Similar"
tier does not discriminate.** Re-instantiating a known failure pattern on a different
application or component is worth roughly zero difficulty — Claude Code actually scores
*higher* on Similar (70.5%) than on Ported (60.8%). Only the New tier collapses, and it
collapses uniformly across all three agents. Porting a mechanism to a new service is not
a difficulty lever; changing the mechanism is.

Corroborating our own record: `03-U1-user-conn-cap` and `03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap` are both
"Similar"-tier moves off `03-F1` (same connection-cap family, same eviction family), and
the rubric's own calibration says the same thing from the other side — F1's answer is
"the reflex every later scenario traps" (`TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` §4).

### 1.2 Faults below the application layer

SG §3.2 and App. D.2, on the `latent_sector_error` problem (intermittent `pread()` errors
injected at a node's storage device): across three Stratus, three Claude Code and three
Codex runs with no noise, **no run produced an aggregated diagnosis score above 0.22, and
fault characterization (D2) scored 0 in every run.** No run proposed disk-level
diagnostics. Agents attributed the I/O errors to application error handling, to memcached
connection resets, and to user workload — "these conclusions never mention that the
underlying hardware can be defective."

Mechanism credited: absence of any model of hardware→software coupling, not a reasoning
failure. §1 frames this as a general design axis — "faults in lower layers such as
operating systems and hardware are known to be harder to address."

**[measured]** the shipped SG corpus has grown past the paper's 90. The denominator below
is **116 entries in the repo's own `Problem List.md`**; for comparison,
`sregym/conductor/problems/` holds 101 `.py` files (the two counts index different things —
the list is the curated catalogue, the directory includes base classes and shares files
across problem variants). By the
`Fault Level` column of `Problem List.md`: Cluster Management 54 (46.6%), App 26 (22.4%),
Container 16 (13.8%), Hardware 12 (10.3%), OS 5 (4.3%). Meanwhile the `Failure Level`
column is `App` for **115 of 116**. That is the design invariant worth copying: the fault
sits anywhere in the stack; the *symptom* is always at the user-facing tier. Depth is a
property of the cause, not of where you look.

### 1.3 Compound failures — metastable, concurrent, correlated

SG §2.4 and App. D.1. The metastable construction is an application-level trigger (an
aggressive retry policy, or a low GOGC) paired with an infrastructure constraint (a CPU
or memory quota). The constraint "produces no errors and no failed traces; it is
discoverable only through explicit inspection of deployment configuration." Recovery
requires removing the constraint *and* restarting to clear the compounded traffic —
"only fixing the trigger would not mitigate the symptoms."

Result: "**no agent across the metastable failure problems identified both interacting
components**" (§3.2). In the single run where Codex found the constraint, "it attributed
the entire failure to it and dismissed the application-level misconfiguration" —
producing, in SG's oracle vocabulary, a diagnosis "correct on localization but wrong on
scope."

That last sentence is the whole design. The compound archetype only discriminates because
SG's diagnosis oracle has a **scope** dimension (App. A, D3-Q1 over-attribution / D3-Q2
under-attribution) at τ = 7/9, which forbids passing while missing an entire dimension. A
compound fault graded on localization alone would score the Codex run as a pass.

**[measured] and honestly:** compound modes are 8 of the 116 catalogued problems (§1.2 on
that denominator) — Metastable
4, Correlated 3, Multiple Independent Failures 1 = **6.9%**. The paper that argues hardest
for compounds ships very few of them. Composability is claimed as the *enabler* (§2 DP3,
3,623 expressible fault-target pairs against 90 curated = 2.5% coverage, App. C); it is not
yet claimed as corpus coverage.

### 1.4 Multi-service scope (AX)

AX **v3 only**: single-service tasks (n=53) average **39.5%** Pass@1; tasks requiring two
or more services (n=47) drop to **18.6%** — a 20.9 percentage-point gap. Credited
mechanism: "models must coordinate authentication, data transformation, and error handling
across multiple APIs simultaneously."

This split does not exist in v1. Anyone citing "AX measures a 20.9-point single-vs-multi
gap" (as `TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md` A4 and `TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md` §6 both do) is
citing v3.

### 1.5 Unfamiliar service semantics

AX v1 §4.3: LocalStack (AWS emulation) 28.1% mean Pass@1 vs Medusa 17.4%. The paper is
explicit that the LocalStack lead "is likely driven by pattern recall, given the likely
prevalence of AWS API documentation in training data", and that the discriminating skill
on Medusa/EspoCRM is "reasoning over deep, nested service-specific hierarchies (e.g.,
understanding that a Product requires Variants, which require Prices per region)".
Frontier models hold >25% on both; weaker models drop below 10%.

This is the cleanest in-paper statement that **familiarity is a confound and unfamiliarity
is a difficulty axis** — and it is the same claim DG makes with contamination probing
(§1.7) arrived at by a completely different route.

### 1.6 High-volume noisy telemetry requiring iterative filtering

AX §2.2 sets the density parameter explicitly: 500–1,000 lines of normal operation mixed
with **10–20 lines of bug symptoms** (1–4%). §5.1/§5.2 then show what that buys:

- Claude Opus 4.5 ran a broad query, saw the volume, refined with `| "ERROR|flush"` and
  cut 6,000+ characters to 1,669.
- DeepSeek V3 "issued a single, unfiltered query that returned 16,515 characters,
  immediately triggering a truncated warning. It then ignored the truncation warning, did
  not refine the query, and patched the files based on incomplete data."

The graded skill is context management. A small, clean corpus cannot expose it — the
symptom density *is* the difficulty dial, and it is authored, not emergent.

### 1.7 Gradual accumulation with a baseline contrast

DG §3.3 states two constraints in one sentence: anomalies "manifest within 5-15 minutes
through standard monitoring tools while requiring sophisticated analytical reasoning
rather than trivial detection." The memory-leak example requires the agent to "capture
system behaviors across requests and analyze subtle variances between normal and buggy
cases" — i.e. the task needs a baseline contrast, not a single unhealthy reading.

DG's monitoring failure taxonomy (§4.2), which is the most directly useful failure
taxonomy in any of the three papers:

| failure class | share | what it is |
|---|---:|---|
| inadequate monitoring methodology | 37% | one-shot `top` instead of `watch -n 1`; "occasionally yielding coincidental correct results on error-free instances" |
| premature conclusion | 26% | answered without monitoring at all |
| interpretation failure | 26% | collected the metrics, analysed them wrongly or not at all |
| insufficient temporal granularity | 11% | 10–60 s sampling, missing transient CPU spikes |

Every one of those four is a *process* failure, not a knowledge failure. This is the
strongest evidence in the literature that a temporally-emergent fault measures something
a statically-present one cannot — and it is the paper-side match for our own A3 criterion.

DG's build taxonomy (§4.2) is different in kind: domain-knowledge gaps 37%,
toolchain/environment instrumentation 33%, multi-step planning 23%, of which "17% of all
failures fall into the 'inherently difficult' category". Knowledge-bound, not process-bound.

### 1.8 Model-separating, not just hard

SG's abstract makes capability spread a benchmark property: "their capabilities varies
significantly in addressing different kinds of failures, with up to 40% differences in
end-to-end results." The complementary observation from SG App. F: **token spend does not
predict success**. Stratus averages 0.53M tokens/run, Claude Code 1.59M (3.0×), Codex
1.93M (3.6×); the highest E2E rate is Claude Code's, but "Stratus configurations land
within a few points of it while spending a small fraction of the tokens", and Codex spends
the most and trails. A task that only rewards budget is not measuring what the benchmark
claims.

---

## 2. Archetypes that saturate, or that produce misleading results

### 2.1 Ported problems

SG §3.2: mitigation above 80% on the ported tier for Stratus+Sonnet; they "introduce
limited challenges". The authors give the reason in the same paragraph: "Most of these
problems are single-fault scenarios focusing on applications and do not include noises."
Port-in is presumptively easy, and the presumption is empirical.

### 2.2 Crash-on-startup / fail-stop faults — the papers disagree

DG §3.3 drops the class outright: "immediate crashes can be simply identified through
console outputs or error logs, limiting the opportunity to evaluate an agent's diagnostic
capability."

SG does not. Table 1 lists "Kill a process or a pod → Fail-stop behavior" as a *fault*
mechanism, and the shipped corpus includes `kubelet_crash` as a Correlated Failure. SG's
implicit position is that fail-stop at a *layer the agent does not look at* (a kubelet, a
node) is not the same as fail-stop at the application layer.

Do not average these. The defensible synthesis is DG's rule scoped to the observable:
**a fault whose symptom is a stack trace at the faulted component is not a diagnosis
task.** SG's `kubelet_crash` satisfies that; a crashlooping app pod does not. Our own
`03-F1` sits on the wrong side of this in a milder form — see §2.7.

### 2.3 Chaos-tool symptom injection

SG §2 DP2 and App. B are the sharpest statement in the literature: chaos tools "inject
symptoms (killed pods, dropped packets, throttled CPUs, latency spikes) rather than
*defects*. There are no underlying faults for an SRE agent to discover, and the only valid
'mitigation' is to stop the chaos injectors, which is not an operational skill an agent
should be rewarded for learning." Named departures: MicroRemed sources faults entirely
from Chaos Mesh; Cloud-OpsBench draws on Chaosblade; **ITBench wraps a Chaos Mesh schedule
for roughly 16% of its SRE scenarios (6 of 36)**.

**[measured]**, and this sharpens the rule rather than contradicting it: SREGym itself
ships Chaos Mesh. `sregym/generators/noise/impl/stress_injector.py` helm-installs it;
`sregym/generators/noise/catalog.py` is a catalogue of Chaos Mesh CRDs (pod-kill,
pod-failure, network-delay 500 ms ± 200 ms jitter, network-loss 50%); `NoiseManager`
(`manager.py`) runs `MAX_CONCURRENT = 2`, `DURATION = 120`, `COOLDOWN = 300` — exactly the
paper's "two noise patterns every five minutes, each one lasting two minutes" (§3). The
`chaos-mesh` namespace is in `HIDDEN_NAMESPACES` alongside `khaos`
(`sregym/service/k8s_proxy.py:36`), and **zero files under `sregym/conductor/problems/`
reference chaos at all**.

So the rule is not "chaos tooling is bad". It is: **chaos tooling is disqualifying for the
graded fault and is the correct off-the-shelf instrument for the ungraded noise floor.**
That distinction is not made in `TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md` A1 or A6, and it matters for
`TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md` §7 (see §5.4).

### 2.4 Alert-clearing and restart-loop oracles

SG App. B, citing the Stratus paper: **8 of 18 ITBench mitigation problems (44%) can be
"solved" by a generic pod-restart loop**, because "the fault injector loses track of the
pod after it is restarted, the alert clears, and the agent is credited with a successful
mitigation (despite taking no action on the actual defects)."

The same class shows up a second time inside SG's own code, caught in review rather than
in a paper. `sregym/conductor/oracles/mitigation.py` captures a baseline deployment set
before evaluating, with the comment: without it "the namespace is still empty and every
replica check below would be skipped, **letting 'scale to 0' and 'delete the deployment'
pass**." The oracle then explicitly fails on `Deployment '{name}' was deleted` and
`Deployment '{name}' was scaled to 0`.

Generalisation: **an oracle that reads only "is the alarm off" admits every band-aid whose
side effect is silence.** Both instances are the same bug wearing different clothes.

### 2.5 Static snapshot / log-triage datasets

SG App. B: "Snapshots reduce the task to static log triage and eliminate the operational
skills the benchmark claims to measure: forming hypotheses, issuing probes, and observing
how the live environment responds. A snapshot also collapses the interactive nature of
troubleshooting." Named target: Cloud-OpsBench. Not a task-shape critique so much as a
substrate one, but it is the reason all three papers ship live environments.

### 2.6 Closed-label single-token classification — the misleading one

DG grades monitoring on "binary accuracy, requiring agents to correctly identify the
specific type of anomaly" (§3.3), with a pytest check that "(1) the diagnosis file exists,
and (2) the diagnosed anomaly type matches the ground truth". SG §2.5 predicts exactly
what goes wrong with such oracles — "brittle because predefined labels are often ambiguous
and not mutually exclusive" — but predicts it as a **false-negative** risk. The shipped
harness has the opposite problem.

**[measured]** against `ucsb-mlsec/DevOps-Gym` @ `9bbe3f0d`, all 34
`tasks/monitor/*/tests/test_outputs.py` share one shape:

```
patterns = [p.strip() for p in first_line.split(',')]
assert len(patterns) == 1
assert "<label>".lower() in patterns[0].lower()
```

Two consequences follow, and they are consequences about the *oracle*, not about any
agent's observed behaviour:

**(a) The constant answer beats every reported agent.** Ground-truth label distribution
across the 34 shipped tasks: `cpu-usage` 9, `memory-leak` 8, `handle-leak` 7, `none` 6,
`io-latency` 2, `disk-leak` 1, `sql-latency` 1. Always answering `cpu-usage` scores
**9/34 = 26.5%**. DG's best reported monitoring result is **20.56%** (Claude Code +
Claude-4-Sonnet, §4.2 Table 1); the next best is 14.70%. Every agent DG reports scores
below the majority-class baseline.

*Caveat, stated plainly:* 26.5% is over the 34 tasks shipped at that SHA; 20.56% is over
whatever §3.3's "30 monitoring tasks" denotes, and the paper is internally inconsistent
about that count (§0.3). The two sets may differ. The finding survives the caveat because
the gap is six points and because the label prior on the measured set is flat enough
(26.5 / 23.5 / 20.6 / 17.6) that no plausible ±4-task difference closes it.

**(b) A single fixed string satisfies all 34 tests.** A comma-free first line containing
all seven labels — e.g. `cpu-usage memory-leak handle-leak io-latency sql-latency
disk-leak none` — passes `len(split(',')) == 1` (no commas) and satisfies every
case-insensitive substring assert, including the six `none` tasks. This is a statement
about oracle admissibility, verified by reading all 34 files; no claim is made that any
agent did this. The shipped instruction does say "The first line must be exactly ONE
pattern-name", but nothing enforces it.

The lesson is not "DG is careless" — DG is the most rigorous of the three on task
*construction* (10+ expert-hours per monitoring task, ~40% of candidates needing multiple
reproduction iterations, three senior engineers independently validating detectability).
The lesson is that **construction rigour does not transfer to oracle rigour**, and that a
free-text answer field graded by substring match is a reward-hacking surface no matter how
carefully the environment behind it was built. AX's second validation stage — "test
validation to ensure that the test suite faithfully evaluates the request without being
susceptible to reward hacking" (§2.1) — is the control DG lacks.

### 2.7 Telemetry that names the answer

Not a named archetype in any paper, but implied by three of them at once: SG D2-Q2 wants
the "concrete mutated details" to be *discoverable*, AX's 1–4% density makes the answer
non-adjacent, DG wants "subtle variances" over a single unhealthy reading. Our own record
has the cleanest instance: `03-F1-connection-cap` declares `causal_distance: 3`, but
`mysql_global_variables_max_connections` and `threads_connected` are both exported, so one
dashboard comparison resolves it (`TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md` A4/B2; RUBRIC §4 scores it
B2=0). It is a correct, working, easy scenario, and the rubric says so.

### 2.8 Floor effects — the archetype that looks maximally discriminative and isn't

DG's end-to-end pipeline tasks: **0% success for every agent on every task** (§4.2). AX v1
Observability Java split: **0.0% for all eight models** across n=10 (§5.3) — and AX
attributes that to a framework confound (all Java tasks use Spring WebFlux, and models
"consistently attempted to solve these tasks using imperative, synchronous patterns"),
i.e. it is a property of the task set, not of Java.

A 0% archetype ranks agents exactly as well as a 100% one: not at all. SG's positive
version of the same criterion is its claim that "their capabilities varies significantly in
addressing different kinds of failures, with up to 40% differences in end-to-end results"
(Abstract) — spread is the property, and a floor has none. DG's per-stage Table 4 is where
the information actually lives; the headline 0% is the least informative number in the
paper.

Worth noting alongside: DG explicitly *does not* filter tasks that all models fail
("difficulty is reported post-hoc"), and neither does AX. Both report the floor rather
than removing it. That is a defensible choice for a leaderboard with hundreds of tasks and
a very expensive one for a corpus of seven eval-ready scenarios per substrate — see §6.3.

---

## 3. Grading design as the determinant of discrimination

Each item pairs the design with the measured failure it was introduced to prevent.

### 3.1 Diagnosis graded separately from repair

**Design.** SG submits twice — a natural-language diagnosis triggering 𝒪_d, then a
mitigation signal triggering 𝒪_m (§2.1) — and reports E2E as the conjunction.

**The measurement.** SG Table 5: when diagnosis is correct, mitigation succeeds 68–89% of
the time; when diagnosis is wrong, **22–62%** (v3; v1 says 35–59%). §3.3 gives the two
mechanisms behind the residual: "the agent often pattern-matches a known symptom to
mitigation actions that can successfully mitigate the failure without understanding its
root cause", and the agent may self-correct by observing persistence — averaging 3.82
mitigation attempts after a wrong diagnosis vs 1.88 after a right one.

**Why it determines discrimination.** Without the diagnosis axis, up to 62% of
wrong-diagnosis runs score as passes. The repair oracle alone cannot see the difference
between understanding and pattern-matching. AX is the negative control here: it grades
repair only (F2P/P2P plus API-level pytest) and therefore cannot report this statistic at
all.

Our position: D6.2's `canonical_report_component` check is this axis, and the rubric's
worked example is the proof it is load-bearing — PR #234 shipped with
`canonical_report_service` only, so "restore `max_user_connections`, then blame
`mariadb.max-connections`" would have passed (`TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` A2).

### 3.2 State-based mitigation oracles, not alert suppression

**Design.** SG's mitigation oracle checks both "whether the target fault is resolved" and
"whether the target system has recovered to a healthy state", using "client-side
observability such as user request success rate and system-side observability" (§2.5).

**The measurement it prevents.** The 44% pod-restart exploit (§2.4 above), plus the
scale-to-zero / delete-the-deployment class caught in `mitigation.py`.

Our analogue is stronger on one axis and weaker on another. Stronger: D6.1 replaced
generator-liveness with `goodput ≥ (1−tol) × offered RPS` precisely because "a server-side
throttle/cache defeats" liveness, and D6.5's frozen soak plus `mariadb_state`
`stable_probes` proves the repair *held*, which SG does not do. Weaker: our health check
is aggregate bands, and the ledger shows twice that a green fence can be vacuous
(entry 4.2, canonical Tier 0: "nop legs failed only report-absence, no impact-class check
ever fired at 32mb"; entry 2.4, "GREEN but scorecard-graded 1-DEFECTIVE-INERT").

### 3.3 The fault plane must be invisible

**Design.** SG hides the injection plane behind a proxy: `HIDDEN_NAMESPACES =
{"chaos-mesh", "khaos"}` and `HIDDEN_LABELS` filtering `app: load-generator`,
`job: workload`, `opentelemetry.io/name: load-generator`
(`sregym/service/k8s_proxy.py:36-45`, with the comment "Load generators produce synthetic
traffic and should not be visible to agents").

**The measurement it prevents.** SG App. B: "Neither AIOpsLab nor ITBench protects against
such reward hacking properly: their fault injectors run as identifiable pods in the same
environment the agent inspects."

Note the second reason for hiding the *load generator* specifically, which is a difficulty
argument rather than a security one: an agent that can see the traffic source can dismiss
the incident as synthetic. Our equivalent is D9/D23 plus `checks/leak_probe.py`, and it is
the repo's strongest suit (`TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md` C4/D4 both score 2 across all
scenarios).

### 3.4 Counterexamples must be executed before merge

**Design.** SG's `/validate-problem` PR directive runs
`tests/integration/validate_problem.py`, whose staged assertions are `oracle_fail`
("Oracle fails after fault injection") then `oracle_pass` ("Oracle passes after
recovery"), with an explicit refusal message when the fault does not bite: "*the injected
fault did not break the application*". `CONTRIBUTING.md`: "Any PR that changes files under
`sregym/conductor/problems/` **must** include a `/validate-problem` line; a gate check
fails the PR otherwise", opt-out requires an explicit `/validate-problem skip`, and — the
line worth keeping — "**Automated validation does not replace human review.**"

**Why it determines discrimination.** This is the FP=FN=0 fence with a merge gate attached.
Our `tools/calibrate.py` is the same instrument. Our gap is the one the rubric names as
blocking and that nothing currently fills: B3 "counterexamples are executed, not asserted".
`run_verifier_v2_matrix.py` has 12 standard cases but is verifier-v2 only, and no Frappe
scenario ships a `qualification/matrix.yaml`. LESSONS.md's formulation is the right one:
"A trap documented in prose is not a trap."

### 3.5 Fail-to-pass plus no-regression, on both sides

DG App. C.1/C.2 and AX §3.2 converge independently: the fix must flip a failing check
*and* not break a passing one. DG's test-generation oracle is the two-sided version — "(i)
at least one generated test fails on the original buggy codebase and passes after patch
application, and (ii) no tests exhibit failures on the patched code."

Our equivalent is the C2 pack conjunction plus `repair_scope` / `minimality`. Note the
shape difference: SWE-style benchmarks get regression protection for free from an existing
test suite; we have to author it as a scope gate, which is why `minimality.capture_sources`
being MariaDB-only (`TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md` §1) is a first-order defect rather than
a nicety.

### 3.6 A checklist judge with a measured κ, or no judge at all

SG's diagnosis oracle is 9 yes/no questions in 3 equally-weighted dimensions, verdict
`1[S ≥ τ]` at τ = 7/9 "which forbids a submission to pass while missing an entire
dimension" (§2.5). Agreement (Table 2): Sonnet-4.6 vs human κ = 0.90; GPT-5.4 vs K2.5
κ = 0.94; the weakest pair, GPT-5.4 vs human, κ = 0.70. The full checklist is App. A,
Table 6 — and read as authoring criteria rather than grading criteria, the nine questions
are a good scenario-design spec: D1-Q2 requires a distinguishable downstream victim,
D2-Q2 requires a nameable mutated value, D3-Q1/Q2 require over- and under-attributable
bystanders.

AX by contrast uses an LM judge (Gemini 3 Pro, T=0.1) for its rubric layer and reports
**no agreement statistic at all**, which is a real weakness relative to SG — but AX keeps
the judge strictly out of the leaderboard: "Rubric criteria are not part of the
Leaderboard and are shared only as part of our secondary analyses" (§3.3). That is the same
architecture as our D12 + advisory `report_judge.py`, arrived at independently.

### 3.7 Agent-architecture neutrality

SG App. B: "AIOpsLab requires the evaluated agent to interact in a ReAct loop mediated by
an orchestrator that parses every action and exposes a fixed set of function signatures.
Agents not built in the ReAct architecture would need to be ported... SREGym keeps its
agent interface minimal: only the `submit()` call is required." Evidence that it works:
the same 90 problems ran against Stratus (multi-agent, custom tools), Claude Code and
Codex, and §3.4 shows the agents organically diverge — Stratus prefers `kubectl patch`
(39–41% of writes), Claude Code and Codex prefer `kubectl rollout` (29–40%), and
observability access is 15–17% of Stratus's calls vs 2–3% for the coding agents.

### 3.8 The one place the papers directly contradict each other

SG §2.5 rejects exact-label matching outright. DG §3.3 grades monitoring on exactly that.
This is a real disagreement and should not be averaged.

**Our primary evidence resolves it in SG's favour, for a reason SG did not anticipate.**
SG's objection is false negatives — "agents often report correct results, but are
incorrectly evaluated due to mismatching brittle labels". The measured hole in DG's
shipped oracle (§2.6) is the opposite: false *positives*, admitted by a substring match on
a free-text line. Both directions are failures of the same design decision — grading a
natural-language answer against a fixed string.

`DECISIONS.md` D12 puts us on DG's side of the argument (no LLM in the grading path), so
we own the brittleness SG names. What is worth stating plainly is that **our
implementation already forecloses the specific defect DG shipped**, and did so before this
review found it:

- The answer is not free text. `substrates/frappe/main/submit_incident_report` accepts
  `(--service, --component, --mechanism)` triples or a `{"findings":[...]}` JSON envelope;
  there is no line for the agent to write prose into that the oracle then greps.
- `loadgen-common/loadgen_grader_common.py::_validate_declare_body` HTTP-400s any finding
  missing a non-empty `service`, `component` or `mechanism`.
- `verifier/oracle/attribution.py` compares canonicalized tokens against a **closed**
  `component_registry` and rejects off-registry tokens (`registry_ok`);
  `_canon_token` normalizes casefold plus a leading `svc-` and nothing else.
- The vocabulary is published to the agent (`report_vocabulary: true` →
  `submit_incident_report --help`) *without* the pairing, so the label ambiguity SG objects
  to is bounded by construction.

The residual risk is exactly the one `TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md` C5/F2 already name — a
spelling drift between `ground_truth`, `solve.sh` and `instruction.md`, invisible to
calibration because golden and nop hardcode the same spelling — and it has fired twice.
That is a false-negative risk, i.e. SG's version of the problem, and it is unfenced.

## 4. Cross-reference against our kill ledger

The verdict for each paper-endorsed archetype on our substrates. **Shipped** = at least one
scenario in `scenarios/` implements it. **Killed** = tried and refuted, with the ledger
entry and the measurement. **Never attempted** = no ledger entry, no scenario; the wall (if
any) is structural rather than measured.

| # | archetype | paper + evidence | our verdict | refuting / enabling measurement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Novel failure *mode* | SG §3.2, New tier 17.9% E2E | **shipped ×1** | `06-queue-write-guard`: healthy 0.00% → faulted ~100% on `rq_enqueue`, predicted at a desk and measured by its fence (ledger, "Reading the record"). `03-statement-time-cap` would have been the second novel head; killed (1.6). |
| 2 | "Similar" re-instantiation | SG §3.2, 58.9% vs 63.7% — no lift | **shipped, and it is most of the corpus** | Six of the seven eval-ready Frappe scenarios sit in one of three same-mechanism pairs: `03-F1`/`03-U1` (`mariadb.max-connections` / `.max-user-connections`), `03-mariadb-read-only`/`03-readonly-flag-fog` (identical pair `mariadb.read-only`), `06-queue-write-guard`/`06-queue-lag-bait` (identical pair `redis_queue.config`). SG measures this tier at ~0 difficulty lift. |
| 3 | Sub-application-layer fault (OS/kernel/HW) | SG §3.2/D.2, diagnosis ≤ 0.22, D2 = 0/9 runs | **never attempted** | No wall measured — no injector exists. `fault_validators.py` closes the surface to three chart families (my.cnf, worker `replicaCount`, redis `extraFlags`); an OS/HW plane is a substrate build, not a scenario. |
| 4 | Metastable (trigger + constraint, survives trigger removal) | SG §2.4/D.1, no agent found both components | **never attempted; blocked by two constraints of different kinds** | A metastable loop needs a queue that feeds back on itself. Constraint 1 is **configuration**: at 0.25 requests in flight there is no queue (W1 — but see §4.3, this is a sizing choice, not physics). Constraint 2 is **structural**: the retry amplifier is absent — frappe's DB layer has "no reconnect/retry, no pre-ping" (ledger 3.1). Fixing sizing is necessary but not sufficient. |
| 5 | Concurrent / correlated (two real faults, two-part answer) | SG §2.4; 8/116 catalogued **[measured]** | **killed — on a stale premise** | Ledger 7.5 cites `attribution.py:242` as "exact set equality against a single ground-truth pair… no expressible two-pair answer". **That is no longer true.** See §4.1. |
| 6 | Multi-service scope | AX v3, 39.5% → 18.6% (20.9 pp) | **shipped, weakly** | Every Frappe scenario declares `causal_distance` 3–4 across the 11-service registry, but `causal_distance` is inert metadata the oracle never reads (CRITERIA A4, `[GAP]`). We ship multi-service *topology*, not multi-service *grading*. |
| 7 | Unfamiliar service semantics | AX v1 §4.3, 28.1% vs 17.4% | **shipped, incidentally** | ERPNext/Frappe is a genuinely low-familiarity stack; nobody has argued this or probed it. CRITERIA D5 (contamination) is `[GAP]`, scored 0 on all three scenarios. |
| 8 | High-volume noisy telemetry, iterative filtering | AX §2.2/§5.2, 1–4% density; 16,515-char failure | **shipped ×1 on slack-spine; never attempted on Frappe** | `13-P1-distractor-volume-shell` is the one distractor-density scenario and it is eval-ready. On Frappe, CRITERIA A6 scores **0 on all three** scored scenarios: no noise module, and `frappe_db`/`frappe_dev_queue` inherit `dev`, which sets no `rate_jitter`. slack-spine additionally ships a seeded log-noise floor (`py/pykit/noise.py`); Frappe does not. |
| 9 | Ambient non-causal noise floor | SG §2 DP1 + §3.1, −5 to −10 diagnosis points | **never attempted — and contra-indicated** | See §5.4. On `frappe_dev_queue` the *healthy* baseline already runs 91.9% peak / 100% trough error on `rq_enqueue` with 5–8 pp run-to-run breathing and a ~3 pp usable corridor (ledger 3.2, 6.2). |
| 10 | Gradual accumulation / metastability-lite | DG §3.3, 5–15 min window; failure taxonomy 37/26/26/11 | **shipped ×1** | `03-QE1-rq-eviction-trap` is the only scenario scoring A3 = 2 ("RQ memory genuinely accumulates to 32 MB — the only real accumulation of the three"). But W10: it failed **every** hosted trial on ephemeral-storage exhaustion — 112 evictions at default volume, **408** at 60 GB. Kind-viable, not hosted-viable. |
| 11 | Contention / locking / capacity exhaustion | SG Table 1 service overloads; classic SRE | **foreclosed by current configuration — revivable, not killed** | Ledger 1.1: full fence GREEN yet **0 fault-attributable failures in 16,524 faulted requests** at SERIALIZABLE (run `32534466571`); 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2 inherit it. The measurements are sound; the *classification* is not. W1's 0.25-in-flight is a provisioning consequence and W7 only refutes the **rps** lever — see §4.3. |
| 12 | Connection-cap exhaustion | ubiquitous production incident | **shipped ×2, but inert; the wall is half-structural** | Scorecard audit (Exp 19) measured `03-F1` and `03-U1` **inert as deployed** — 0 fault-attributable failures across ~18,000 and 9,108 faulted requests. W8: MariaDB clamps `max_connections` to a **hard minimum of 10** (`Warning 1292`) — that floor *is* structural. But the other half of W8 is the measured burst high-water of **4–6**, which is a demand figure and therefore configuration: raise concurrent demand past 10 and a legal cap sits below it again (ledger 2.4, §4.3). |
| 13 | Cache-tier eviction / memory pressure | DG §3.1 resource anomalies; SG valkey OOM | **killed ×3** | W2. Ledger 4.1: **4/32 logins 500'd** under a 2 MB ceiling, both legs dead pre-episode (run `32686813767`). 4.2 carries the same strike plus a vacuous Tier-0 fence. 4.3 (`06-queue-silent-loss`) inverted: repaired 0.25 vs broken 0.636 completion (run `32867490471`). |
| 14 | Worker / replica scaling ("scale the workers") | DG monitoring; classic | **killed** | W4. `reconfigure-infra.sh` dispatches only `mariadb\|redis-cache\|redis-queue`; no kubectl/helm in the agent image; `restart-svc.sh` only signals existing pods — so no golden repair can scale a Deployment. Ledger 5.1. Note the cost of reviving it: it would blunt `03-QE1`, where scale-workers is a named deflection trap. |
| 15 | Global execution-limit faults (statement time, query cost) | SG service overloads; DG query inefficiency | **killed** | W9, discovered 2026-08-25. The grader's own `schema_fingerprint` probe measures **3.5–4 s** on a DocType-shaped site and runs at BASELINE, so any server-wide statement limit kills the evidence collection before it can grade — killed at every dial from 0.05 s to 2.0 s. Ledger 1.6. |
| 16 | Healthy instance ("nothing is wrong") | DG §3.3 + §4.2 "significant false positives"; 6/34 = 17.6% of the shipped set **[measured]** | **never attempted** | Structurally unsubmittable — see §4.2. |
| 17 | Fail-to-pass with regression protection | DG App. C; AX §3.2 | **shipped (substrate-level)** | C2 pack conjunction + `minimality` + `repair_scope`. Constrained by the capture surface being my.cnf only: ledger 7.4 measured `06`'s golden verdict recording `minimality.mutated_keys == []` **despite the repair mutating an allow-listed redis key**. |
| 18 | Executed counterexample suite | SG `/validate-problem`; AX §2.1 stage 2 | **never executed on Frappe** | RUBRIC B3 = ❌ for `03-F1`, `03-QE1`; ⚠️ for `03-U1`. `run_verifier_v2_matrix.py` is v2-only and no Frappe scenario ships `qualification/`. |
| 19 | Contamination probing | DG §3.1 + App. B, C ≥ 0.2 exclusion, git metadata stripped | **never attempted** | CRITERIA D5 `[GAP]`; `DECISIONS.md` Q17 open. Distinct from D1 (in-band leak), which is strong. |
| 20 | Multi-stage pipeline (build → monitor → fix → test) | DG §3.5, 0% for everyone | **never attempted, and should not be** | Floor effect (§2.8), and our episode model is one declaration with a terminal freeze (D23). |

**Counts over the 20 archetypes above: 8 shipped · 5 killed · 7 never attempted.**

- *Shipped* (rows 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17) — but five of the eight carry a stated
  qualification: rows 6 and 7 are shipped incidentally rather than by design, row 8 only on
  slack-spine, row 12 is shipped and **measured inert**, and row 10 is shipped and **not
  hosted-viable**.
- *Killed* (rows 5, 11, 13, 14, 15) spanning 14 of the ledger's 25 entries — 1.1–1.6, 2.1,
  2.2, 4.1–4.3, 5.1, 6.1, 7.5 — and 6 of its 10 walls (W1, W2, W4, W7, W8, W9). Row 5 is
  counted here on the ledger's own accounting and re-opened at §4.1.
- *Never attempted* (rows 3, 4, 9, 16, 18, 19, 20) — no measurement refutes any of them.
  Rows 3, 4 and 20 have structural reasons; rows 16, 18 and 19 do not, and are where §5
  looks first.

**A separate observation from the same census, and possibly the most consequential one for
the corpus.** Six of the seven eval-ready Frappe scenarios are one half of a
same-mechanism pair (row 2), and `tasks/INDEX.json` shows `hosted_ready: false` for all 13
generated tasks on both substrates. SG Table 4 measures the "Similar" tier — same failure
pattern, different component — at essentially the same difficulty as the ported tier
(58.9% vs 63.7% E2E for Stratus+Sonnet; *higher* for Claude Code). If that transfers, most
of the Frappe corpus's *nominal* size is not corpus *diversity*, and the two scenarios that
would carry the discriminative weight are `03-QE1` (the only real accumulation mechanism,
and hosted-unviable per W10) and `06-queue-write-guard` (the only measured wide corridor).

The shape of that distribution is the honest headline: **the archetypes the papers rate
most discriminative are, on our substrate, mostly in the never-attempted column, not the
killed one.** The kill ledger's density is concentrated on *load-physics* archetypes
(contention, caps, cache pressure) that the papers barely discuss, while the
*epistemic* archetypes the papers actually credit — scope discipline, false-positive
resistance, noise tolerance, telemetry filtering — have never been tested here at all.

### 4.1 The compound-failure wall is real, but it is in a different file than the ledger says

This is the highest-value cell in the table, so it was checked against source rather than
inherited.

Ledger 7.5 states: "structural — `set_match` is **exact set equality against a single
ground-truth (service, component) pair** (`attribution.py:242`); there is no expressible
two-pair answer, so a genuine compound has no gradable ground truth." Its revival
condition is "multi-pair ground truth in the grading contract (grader change ⇒ moves every
grader fingerprint ⇒ full requalification)."

Reading the four layers involved on this branch:

1. **Agent tool — supports N findings.** `substrates/frappe/main/submit_incident_report`
   header: "An incident may have ONE OR MORE root-cause findings… Report 1..N findings;
   each finding needs all three of `--service`/`--component`/`--mechanism`." Flag form
   consumes repeated triples positionally; body form accepts a `{"findings":[…]}`
   envelope.
2. **Declare endpoint — supports N findings.** `_validate_declare_body` iterates
   `findings[i]` and requires the triple per finding; nothing caps the count.
3. **v1 oracle — supports N pairs.** `verifier/oracle/attribution.py::required_set()`
   draws from `ground_truth_set` "when present (the COMPOUND, >1 pair), else from the
   single `ground_truth`", and `set_match = reported_set == req` is set equality over that
   set, with `missing` and `extra` reported. The single-finding `service_match` /
   `component_match` fields are explicitly "back-compat telemetry… NOT separately gating".

   **[executed]** — `evaluate_attribution` run directly against a two-pair
   `ground_truth_set` (`mariadb.read-only` + `redis_queue.config`) over a synthetic
   two-service registry:

   | reported findings | `set_match` | `registry_ok` | `missing` | `extra` |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | both pairs | **True** | True | — | — |
   | one pair only | False | True | `redis_queue.config` | — |
   | both + a bystander | False | True | — | `redis_queue.capacity` |
   | one pair + off-registry token | False | **False** | `redis_queue.config` | `redis_queue.invented` |

   The v1 path is live, not bit-rotted. Note what the second and third rows are: `missing`
   is under-attribution and `extra` is over-attribution — i.e. the oracle already computes
   SG's D3-Q2 and D3-Q1 scope dimensions (App. A, Table 6) deterministically, without a
   judge. That is the axis the compound archetype needs, and we have it.
4. **Injection — explicitly supports two families.** `validate_config_tier`'s own
   docstring: "**Touching two families in ONE spec is legal**, and each is validated
   independently. This validator's job is confinement — which chart keys a fault may reach
   — not fault-count policy."
5. **verifier-v2 materializer — hard-codes exactly one.**
   `tools/verifier_v2/materializers/incident_report.py`:

   ```
   finding = findings[0] if isinstance(findings, list) and len(findings) == 1 else None
   ...
   "pass": (isinstance(findings, list) and len(findings) == 1 and ...)
   ```

   **[executed]** — `materialize()` run against three report shapes:

   | `report.json` | `pass` | `submitted` | `finding_count` | `service` / `component` |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | one finding | True | True | 1 | populated |
   | **two findings** | **False** | True | 2 | **None / None** |
   | zero findings | False | True | 0 | None / None |
   | file absent | — | — | — | raises `EvidenceError` |

   Since v2 grades attribution through `canonical_report_service` /
   `canonical_report_component` pointers into this materializer's output, **a correct
   two-part answer fails the v2 contract by construction** — the service and component the
   contract reads are `None`.

So the corrected statement is:

> The compound archetype is expressible at the injector, at the agent tool, at the declare
> endpoint and in the v1 oracle. It is foreclosed by roughly fifteen lines in
> `tools/verifier_v2/materializers/incident_report.py` — and only there.

The ledger's *cost* estimate is still right (a materializer change is inside the stamped
source closure, so it moves the grader fingerprint and forces requalification —
`TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md` §2 says the same about `tools/verifier_v2`). Its *location*
and its "no expressible two-pair answer" premise are stale. `ground_truth_set` landed with
commit `41b25337a` (the XID-wraparound family `06-F2a/b/c`); that scenario family has since
been deleted, and **no scenario in `scenarios/` uses `ground_truth_set` today** — the
capability is present and unexercised.

Two things this does *not* license. First, `TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md` A5's "`[GAP]` no
fault composition API; a `fault:` block injects exactly one thing" is also imprecise: a
config-tier overlay is a nested mapping and may name two families. Second, and more
important: fixing the materializer does not make SG's *metastable* problems reachable.
Metastability needs congestive collapse, and W1/W7 say we cannot produce it. What the fix
unlocks is SG's **concurrent** and **correlated** modes — two independently-diagnosable
faults, or one cause with two visible components — which are the modes whose difficulty
comes from *scope discipline* rather than from load physics. That distinction is exactly
SG D3-Q1/D3-Q2, and it is the archetype where the Codex run failed "correct on
localization but wrong on scope."

### 4.2 The healthy-instance wall is deliberate and named

`TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md` §8 locates the blocker at "the report schema requires a
non-null finding" and estimates "a small oracle change". The actual guard is more specific
and better-reasoned than that, and it lives one layer lower —
`loadgen-common/loadgen_grader_common.py::_validate_declare_body`, i.e. **shared by both
substrates**:

```
"""Reject bodies that cannot become a non-empty incident report.

Direct `/declare` probes with `{}` or `{"findings":[]}` used to freeze the
first-shot declaration as an empty report. The oracle would fail correctly,
but the failure mode measured endpoint probing more than repair quality. Keep
fail-loud semantics by returning HTTP 400 before mutating report.json.
"""
...
if not isinstance(findings, list) or not findings:
    raise ValueError("declare body must contain at least one finding")
```

So "nothing is wrong" is not merely unrepresentable in the report schema — it is
**HTTP-400'd at the declare endpoint, on purpose, to close an endpoint-probing exploit**.
Any healthy-instance design that works by relaxing this guard re-opens that exploit. The
design that does not is a *positive* null answer: a reserved registry token or an explicit
`--no-fault` mode, so the healthy verdict is an assertion the agent has to make rather than
an empty body it can send by accident. That preserves the property the guard was built for.

**[executed], and this is the good news:** everything *downstream* of that guard already
handles the null answer. The v2 materializer probe above shows a zero-finding
`report.json` materializing cleanly as `{"finding_count": 0, "submitted": true,
"pass": false}` — no exception, and `finding_count` is a JSON-pointer-addressable value, so
a v2 outcome check could assert `equals: 0` against it without touching the materializer
at all. (`pass: false` is the correct verdict for the *fault-reporting* semantics and must
not be observed here; the C6 anti-laundering rule already forbids observing a materializer's
`/pass` in this situation.) The only thing standing between us and a healthy-instance
scenario is one guard in `loadgen-common`, plus a vocabulary decision about how the agent
says "nothing".

**[executed]** also settles the alternative: an agent that files *no* report at all does
not produce a graded "no fault" verdict — `read_json(..., required=True)` raises
`EvidenceError`, so the run fails as an infrastructure error. Silence cannot be the answer;
the answer has to be spoken.

The injection half is already solved and demonstrated in-repo: `00-BASE-health`'s spec
comments record that `validate_config_tier` "dies with 'overlay names no fault family' on
`values: {}`", so the overlay "restates the chart's HEALTHY configuration VERBATIM". A
healthy-instance scenario can reuse that pattern unchanged.

---

## 5. Recommendations, ranked

Each states the wall it must clear and the cheapest test that would kill it early.
Ranking is value-for-cost, with a bias toward tests that cost zero CI.

### 5.1 First — the healthy-instance ("no fault") shape

**Why first.** It is the only archetype where a paper's *measured* failure mode maps onto a
capability our corpus has exactly zero of. DG §4.2: "agents exhibit poor baseline
discrimination, generating significant false positives by misinterpreting normal
operational variance as anomalies in healthy system environments" — and 17.6% of DG's
shipped monitoring set exists to measure it **[measured]**. Nothing in our corpus can see a
false positive: every scenario has a fault, so an agent that always reports *something*
never pays. It is also the cheapest archetype physically: no fault to calibrate, no
corridor to find, no W1/W7/W8/W9 exposure, and the golden trajectory is the nop.

**The wall — located precisely, and it is a single guard.** `_validate_declare_body`
(`loadgen-common/loadgen_grader_common.py`) rejects a zero-finding report with HTTP 400,
by design, to close an endpoint-probing exploit (§4.2). That is the only structural
blocker: **[executed]**, the v2 materializer already emits `finding_count: 0` for a
zero-finding report without raising, so the evidence layer needs no change.
`read_json(..., required=True)` does raise on an absent `report.json`, which means "say
nothing" cannot be the answer — but that is a feature, not an obstacle: the healthy verdict
should be a positive assertion, which is also what keeps the anti-probing property intact.

**Cheapest killing test — desk-only, zero CI, and it is the last open question.** Write a
`verification:` block whose outcome check observes
`/checks/incident_report/value/finding_count` with `equals: 0` (plus the existing health
packs) and run `tools/verifier_v2/contract.py` over it. That answers for free whether the
contract layer accepts a null-finding pass condition. Nothing in `contract.py`'s rules
obviously forbids it — it requires only "one non-empty checks list", and the C6
anti-laundering rule that forbids observing a materializer's `/pass` is satisfied by
observing `/value/finding_count` instead. If it passes, the remaining work is one
sanctioned way to *submit* the null answer (a reserved token or a `--no-fault` flag, plus
roughly ten lines in `_validate_declare_body`) and the archetype is reachable. If
`contract.py` refuses, the archetype needs a materializer change too and drops below §5.2.

**What would still need arguing.** A healthy-instance task inverts the FP=FN=0 fence: the
"golden" run reports nothing and the "nop" run is an agent that reports a phantom. Whether
`calibrate.py` can express that inversion is the second question, and it should be
answered before authoring, not after.

### 5.2 Second — a two-part answer (SG's *concurrent* / *correlated* mode)

**Why second.** SG's compound modes are the sharpest discriminator in any of the three
papers — "no agent across the metastable failure problems identified both interacting
components" — and the scope dimension that makes them gradeable (D3-Q1 over-attribution,
D3-Q2 under-attribution) is the one diagnostic axis our attribution oracle already
computes (`missing` and `extra` are both reported by `set_match`). Three of the four layers
already support it (§4.1).

**The wall.** `tools/verifier_v2/materializers/incident_report.py`'s `len(findings) == 1`.
Cost: a materializer change is inside the stamped source closure, so it moves the grader
fingerprint and requires requalifying the Frappe catalogue (~6 trials per task). Not a base
release.

**The first killing test has already been run, and it passed.** Using the
`evaluate_mariadb_state` pattern from `TASK-QUALITY-RUBRIC.md` A3 unchanged — construct a
manifest with a two-pair `ground_truth_set`, feed `evaluate_attribution` a synthetic
two-finding report — the v1 path returns `set_match: True` for the correct compound and
discriminates under-attribution (`missing`) from over-attribution (`extra`) and from
off-registry tokens (`registry_ok: False`). Full table at §4.1. `ground_truth_set` has not
bit-rotted since `06-F2c` was deleted, so the materializer change is genuinely the small
half of the job.

**The second wall, which is the one that will actually bite.** A compound needs two faults
that each produce a client-measured corridor *and* whose corridors do not swamp each other.
Ledger 6.2 killed the "naive QE1 compound" precisely there: the usable corridor on
`rq_enqueue` at `frappe_dev_queue` is ~3 pp and `03-QE1` already occupies it. So the corridor
pre-check must be run on the **combined** mechanism, not per leg — which is exactly the
lesson ledger 1.5 already recorded for interaction candidates. The plausible first compound
is therefore *not* two faults in one tier but one fault plus one **deliberately inert
second component** in a different service, where the second pair is diagnosable from config
rather than from load. That is SG's *correlated* mode (shared cause, two visible
components) and it costs no additional corridor.

**The remaining killing test — desk-only, zero CI.** Before authoring anything, take an
existing shipped scenario and re-run its corridor pre-check with the *second* component's
knob also perturbed, against the archived fence artifacts. If the combined corridor is not
measurably wider than the single-fault one — or if it moves the graded driver by less than
the profile's 5–8 pp run-to-run breathing — stop. That is ledger 1.5's screen applied to
the combined mechanism, and it is the screen that would have killed the naive QE1 compound
(ledger 6.2) for free.

### 5.3 Third — `03-bufferpool-squeeze`, the ledger's own unattempted candidate

**Why third.** The ledger says it plainly: "It is **not refuted** — it is unattempted, and
it is the cheapest remaining candidate for a future batch because its enabling work is
already merged" (runtime allowlist entry, chunk-size startup gate, and a local semantics
probe that PASSED with exact read-backs and a single-variable diff). It is also a genuine
*accumulation* mechanism — a shrunk buffer pool degrades as the working set grows, which is
DG §3.3's shape — and it is runtime-tier, which is the substrate's least-exercised plane.

**The wall.** W9: the grading plane shares the fault's blast radius. A buffer-pool squeeze
does not constrain statement execution globally the way `max_statement_time` did, so it is
not obviously fatal — but the grader's own `schema_fingerprint` probe is a 3.5–4 s
`information_schema` scan on a DocType-shaped site, and an `information_schema` scan is
precisely the kind of query a shrunk buffer pool slows down. Secondary walls: W1 (if the
observable needs contention, it is dead) and W3 (bring-up runs ~400 tables of DDL against
the squeezed pool).

**Cheapest killing test — local docker probe, zero CI.** Reuse the exact method that killed
`03-statement-time-cap` for free: pinned image
(`bitnamilegacy/mariadb:10.6.17-debian-11-r10`), seeded to DocType shape (1000 tables /
18000 columns), `--cpus=1 -m 1g`, and time three statements at each candidate
`innodb_buffer_pool_size` — the grader's `schema_fingerprint`, the graded desk query, and
`bench new-site`'s DDL burst. Kill it at the desk if the grader's probe degrades more than
the graded workload does. That comparison is the whole test, and it costs one afternoon and
no validation runs. The `03-statement-time-cap` entry (1.6) is the template, down to the
per-dial table.

### 5.4 Do not pursue: an ambient noise floor on Frappe (this contradicts SG)

`TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md` §12 already ranks noise last on cost grounds. The stronger
argument is that on our measured substrate it would not deliver the benefit SG claims —
see §6.1. If a noise floor is built, build it on `frappe_db` (whose baseline is healthy),
never on `frappe_dev_queue`, and re-fit bands with noise present before claiming anything.

One thing the SREGym clone does change: the *design* cost. SG's entire noise plane is
off-the-shelf Chaos Mesh CRDs plus a ~200-line scheduler and a namespace on the proxy's
hide list (§2.3). We would not need to invent a noise primitive. It does **not** change the
*calibration* cost, which is our actual cost driver — a sidecar capability plus a chart
overlay is a `build_inputs` change, which moves `base_fingerprint`, forces a Frappe base
release, and invalidates every stamped calibration on the substrate. The killing test for
`TASK-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md` §7 is therefore not "can we inject noise" (yes, trivially)
but **"can the noise plane be delivered from the private side without entering
`build_inputs`"** — a `tools/task_dev/core.py::classify()` probe on a throwaway branch,
which is desk-cheap and should be run before any design work.

### 5.5 Do not pursue: reviving Families 1, 2 or 6

W1 and W7 together are the substrate's hardest constraint and they are mutually
reinforcing: below the 8-concurrent-request SUT ceiling nothing contends, and above it the
*healthy* baseline is already degraded (p90 3,302.9 ms, 31% error at 300 rps, n=6). "Raise
the load" is not an available lever. Anything whose observable requires overlapping
transactions is dead until the web tier gets capacity — a base-image plus chart change with
full-corpus recalibration cost. Ledger 1.1–1.5, 2.1–2.4, 6.1.

### 5.6 Process, not archetype: execute the counterexamples

RUBRIC B3 is blocking and is ❌ or ⚠️ on all three scored Frappe scenarios. SG makes the
equivalent check a **merge gate** with a mandatory PR directive and an explicit opt-out
token (§3.4). Ours is a manual pre-push step in AUTHORING-FRAPPE §10 that nothing runs.
This is not a new archetype and it will not make any scenario harder, but it is the single
item that converts our existing traps from prose into evidence, and every archetype above
depends on it: a compound answer whose "wrong half" has never been executed is not a
compound task, it is a claim.

## 6. Where our measured evidence contradicts a paper

### 6.1 SG says noise is mandatory; on our queue profile it would destroy measurability

**The paper.** SG §2, Design Principle 1: "A clean, quiet environment is not only
unrealistic but also hard to challenge AI." §3.1, Table 3: injecting noise costs
**every** agent-model pair diagnosis accuracy — Stratus+Sonnet 61.5% → 51.5%,
Stratus+K2.5 41.3% → 38.9%, Claude Code 72.6% → 62.6%, Codex 70.0% → 59.3% — with E2E down
for all four configurations. §3.1 gives the mechanism: "all the evaluated agents take a
greedy approach: they always treat the first plausible anomaly as the target failure (which
can be a noise)."

**Our measurement.** On `frappe_dev_queue`, the **healthy** baseline already runs
**91.9% peak / 100% trough error** on `rq_enqueue`, graded signals breathe **5–8 pp**
run-to-run, and the usable corridor at that ceiling is **~3 pp** (ledger 6.2, from the
`frappe_dev_queue` health record, n=6, captured 2026-08-21). `03-QE1` rides exactly that
edge — a 0.93 band against 0.969 faulted — and ledger 6.2 concludes it "is likely the only
fault that fits there." Ledger 3.2 is the same physics seen from the fence: on
`05-queue-idle-cut`, golden 91.9% error vs nop 93.4%, i.e. **the fault added 1.5 pp on
≥2 pp of run-to-run noise, and the repaired run failed *more* in trough than the faulted
one.**

**Why this is a genuine contradiction and not a scope quibble.** SG's noise result assumes
a substrate whose clean baseline has headroom: their diagnosis rates start at 61–73%, so a
10-point noise penalty leaves a measurable band. Ours starts saturated. Adding a noise
floor to a 3 pp corridor does not make the task harder for the agent; it makes the *verdict*
non-reproducible, which fails E1 (FP=FN=0) rather than raising difficulty. SG never faced a
substrate where the healthy baseline was already the ceiling, and the paper's own
Limitations section concedes only that its noise *model* is simplified (App. H), not that
noise could be inapplicable.

The scoped conclusion: **noise is a difficulty dial only where the clean corridor is wide.
Where it is narrow, noise is measurement error with better branding.** `TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md`
A6's severity note already reaches half of this — it rates the criterion nice-to-have
"only because the Frappe substrate offers no mechanism". That is too generous to the
criterion. On `frappe_dev_queue` specifically, A6 should be rated **not applicable**, with
the corridor measurement as the reason, and re-rated only per-profile.

### 6.2 DG grades monitoring on exact-label match; its shipped oracle shows SG was right

Covered in full at §2.6 and §3.8. Summarised as a contradiction: DG §3.3 explicitly adopts
"binary accuracy, requiring agents to correctly identify the specific type of anomaly" and
`TASK-QUALITY-CRITERIA.md` C5 records that "this repo takes DevOps-Gym's side *by
decision* (D12) and so inherits exactly the brittleness SREGym names." The measurement
**[measured]** on the shipped harness is that the brittleness runs in the other direction
too — a substring match on a free-text line admits a constant string that passes all 34
tasks, and the majority-class baseline (26.5%) exceeds every agent DG reports (best
20.56%).

Our version of that hole is closed, and it was closed by a structural decision rather than
by anticipating this: the answer is a `(service, component, mechanism)` triple validated at
the declare endpoint against a closed registry, not a line of prose. C5's self-assessment
("we own the brittleness") is therefore *too pessimistic* about the false-positive
direction and correctly worried about the false-negative one (the unfenced token-grep,
CRITERIA C5/F2, which has fired twice).

### 6.3 Methodology, not findings: DG and AX report the floor; we cannot afford to

DG "does not describe removing tasks that all models pass or all models fail" and reports
17% of build failures as "inherently difficult" *post hoc* as evidence the benchmark is
hard (§4.2). AX likewise ships a Java split at 0.0% across all eight models and reports it
(§5.3). Both are defensible at their scale: DG has 704 tasks, AX has 200, and a floor-effect
subset costs them a few percent of a leaderboard.

Our kill discipline is the exact inverse — corridor pre-check, desk screen, local probe,
1+1 probe, full fence only when every screen passes — and the ledger's economics are the
justification, not a preference: batch-2 closed **7 candidates / 0 shipped** for a total of
2 full fences + 1 probe + desk arithmetic, and batch-3's design triage killed its remaining
classes for **zero CI**. At ~30 minutes of CI per fence against a corpus of eight, ex-ante
screening is the only affordable policy, and the ledger exists precisely so the resulting
small corpus reads as measurement rather than as selection.

The one thing worth importing from their side: DG and AX both *publish* the floor. Our
equivalent would be publishing the inert scenarios as inert. Ledger 2.4 and the Exp-19
scorecard already measure `03-F1` and `03-U1` as injection-presence-only, and W8 states the
corpus decision that `03-F1` "remains the family's injection-presence labeled baseline".
That label belongs in the task metadata where a consumer of the benchmark can see it, not
only in the ledger.

## 7. Summary of what this review changes

| claim in our docs | status after reading primary sources |
|---|---|
| Ledger 7.5: compound answers structurally ungradeable at `attribution.py:242` | **stale, and refuted by execution.** v1 `evaluate_attribution` returns `set_match: True` for a two-pair answer today; agent tool, declare endpoint and injector all support N. The wall is `len(findings) == 1` in the v2 materializer (§4.1) |
| CRITERIA A5: "no fault composition API; a `fault:` block injects exactly one thing" | **imprecise.** `validate_config_tier`'s docstring says two families in one spec is legal (§4.1) |
| IMPROVEMENTS §8: healthy-instance blocked by "the report shape", needs "a small oracle change" | **relocated and narrowed.** Blocked at `_validate_declare_body` in `loadgen-common`, deliberately, to close an endpoint-probing exploit. The evidence layer needs no change at all — a zero-finding report already materializes as `finding_count: 0` (§4.2, §5.1) |
| CRITERIA A6: noise floor is nice-to-have "because Frappe offers no mechanism" | **too generous.** On `frappe_dev_queue` it is contra-indicated by a measured 3 pp corridor (§6.1) |
| CRITERIA A1/A6: chaos tooling is the anti-pattern | **needs scoping.** Disqualifying for the graded fault; correct for the ungraded noise floor, which is how SREGym itself uses it (§2.3) |
| RUBRIC B2: "DG Normal Cases (14.3% of monitoring tasks)" | **wrong figure.** Not in the paper; measured 6/34 = 17.6% (§0.2) |
| `research/2601.08806.md` provenance note ("v1") | **wrong version.** Content is v3 (§0.2) |
| RUBRIC A2 vs `research/2605.07161.md` on SG Table 5 | **two versions cited as one.** 22–62% is v3; 35–59% is v1 (§0.2) |
| CRITERIA C5: "we own the brittleness SREGym names" | **half right.** False-positive direction is closed by the triple + closed registry; false-negative direction (token drift) remains unfenced (§6.2) |
