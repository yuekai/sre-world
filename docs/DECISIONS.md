# SRE-World — Decision log

Resolved forks, with the downstream obligations each one creates. Cross-references are to `archive/QUESTIONS.md`.

The current repo structure is D14's substrate/scenario model with D22's packaging
boundary: authored `substrates/` + `scenarios/` and committed, directly runnable
self-contained tasks under `tasks/`.

---

## D1 (2026-06-06) — Lead claim: causal-distance grading
**Decision:** Reposition the benchmark's lead novelty claim to **explicit causal-distance / causal-path-graded root-cause scoring**, with temporal emergence as the second controlled axis — verified unoccupied across AIOpsLab, ITBench, Cloud-OpsBench, DevOps-Gym, IaC-Eval, and SREGym (archive/QUESTIONS.md F1/F2, A15). SREGym becomes the cited primary baseline; framing is "controlled difficulty instrument layered on the existing live-SRE paradigm," not "first to do emergent faults / live repair."

**Obligations created:**
- Rewrite PRD §1 (thesis) and the related-work table: fix the Cloud-OpsBench characterization (frozen snapshots, RCA-only), drop IaC-Eval to "adjacent capability," add SREGym + the minor benchmarks (RCAEval, SREBench, o11y-bench, HORIZON) to the verification list.
- Causal distance must now be **operationally defined and measurable** (e.g., hops in the service dependency/call graph between fault-origin and symptom-emitting service), since it is the headline rather than flavor. The score-vs-causal-distance curve becomes the benchmark's signature artifact.
- Deep-verify SREGym's paper/repo before any external claim (one scout pass conceded the territory; confirm their "metastable failures" are not parameterized emergence before final wording).

## D2 (2026-06-06) — Fault presentation: mixed, as a reported axis
**Decision:** Scenarios ship in **both** presentation modes, labeled per scenario: `committed` (fault baked into the source of truth with plausible history, no reachable known-good reference) and `drift` (running state diverges from visible spec, baselines deliberately scrubbed). Presentation is a first-class reported axis alongside causal distance and emergence.

**Obligations created:**
- Scenario schema gets a `fault_presentation` field; results must be reported broken down by it (does agent strategy change between modes? — this is itself a publishable finding).
- A **third validation gate**: *no-reachable-baseline check*. For `drift` scenarios, an automated sweep must verify no git history / original spec / backup / image-default path reveals the seeded change by diffing (the adversarial lens rated unscrubbed drift "indefensible"). For `committed` scenarios, verify the authored history is plausible (no single suspicious last commit that fingers the fault).
- For `committed` scenarios there is no revert target, so "correct" must be defined as a range/invariant — consistent with D3.

## D3 (2026-06-06) — Oracle: dual-gate
**Decision:** Remediation passes only if **both** gates pass:
1. **Outcome gate:** the violated invariant/relationship is restored under sustained load (dwell window + post-declaration soak), measured against the baseline-as-function, with the existing anti-cheat invariants.
2. **Attribution gate:** the agent submits a **structured root-cause attribution** (service, component, mechanism) that matches the injection manifest.

**Obligations created:**
- Design the attribution rubric: schema, match criteria (exact entity match vs. graded), and how partial credit interacts with the Localization/Diagnosis stages (the attribution gate may *merge* §7's diagnosis stage into the oracle — resolve the double-counting).
- The authoritative health signal must be **rate-limited or hidden** from the agent, or the attribution gate is bypassed by brute-force sweep + post-hoc rationalization (archive/QUESTIONS.md Q3).
- Dwell + soak must be **sized per fault to its recurrence period** (a masked leak must have time to re-manifest), making dwell an authored per-scenario parameter, not a global constant (Q7).
- Blanket overprovisioning now fails the attribution gate even when it passes the outcome gate — the panel's Q1/Q2-gamer concern is structurally closed.

## D4 (2026-06-06) — Harness stack: Harbor → (E2B | local) → (Compose | K8s)
> Updated by D14: the substrate is now a single Slack-clone Helm chart on the helm backend (kind/k3d per trial); the per-scenario Compose|K8s choice and E2B isolation are superseded — the oracle/observability/grader-isolation design carries into `substrates/slack-spine/`.

**Decision:** Build the harness as **Harbor framework tasks** (orchestration, agent adapters, benchmark packaging), running on **E2B sandboxes in the cloud or local Docker for development**, with the SUT deployed inside the sandbox via **either Compose or K8s (k3s) per scenario** — substrate is a scenario property, not a global commitment.

**Obligations created:**
- The per-fault **expressibility matrix** (Q11) still must be built — it now decides which substrate each *scenario* declares, rather than a global fork. Orchestration-native faults (HPA, replica ratios, requests-vs-limits) live on k3s scenarios; config/data faults can stay on Compose where iteration is cheaper.
- Spike must validate: (a) Harbor supports long-episode, stateful tasks with an out-of-band in-sandbox process (load gen namespaced away from the agent — archive/QUESTIONS.md F7); (b) E2B snapshot/resume yields a functionally healthy stack given the socket-drop caveat (Q10); (c) k3s-in-microVM footprint and reset time vs Compose.
- Phase 4 shrinks: Claude Code / OpenHands / Codex CLI are Harbor-pre-integrated — the "agentic-SRE product" adapter question (Q15) can be deferred without losing the ≥3-agent target.
- Local-backend parity must be bounded: resource-saturation scenarios are **cloud-only** (pinned profile) or the noise budget (Q9) is unmanageable; local is for development and the config/data classes.

## D5 (2026-06-06) — Phase-0 spike: `pool-exhaustion-cyclical` (Variant A) on a purpose-built SUT
> Updated by D14: the substrate is now a single Slack-clone Helm chart on the helm backend (kind/k3d per trial); this fault is now scenario 03-F1 on it. The standalone Compose SUT is superseded — the oracle/observability/grader-isolation design carries into `substrates/slack-spine/`.

**Decision:** The spike fault archetype is **app-pool exhaustion emerging under cyclical load** (Andre's dictated design: simple system, logs continuously clean at baseline, symptoms only at load peaks). Substrate is a **purpose-built FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Postgres single service**, replacing PRD §9 Phase 0's Sock Shop — forced by two red-team findings: Sock Shop is archived *and* contains no Postgres (Mongo/MySQL), so the PRD's fault and substrate were mutually incompatible. Variant B (app pool max > PG `max_connections`) is rejected for the spike (sticky/latching, breaks cyclical recovery, PG-wide blast radius) and reserved as a harder library scenario. **Historical update:** D15 implements it experimentally as 03-F1b; the rejection from the original spike remains the reason runtime re-convergence must be re-proved. Full spec: `archive/SPIKE.md`.

**Obligations created:**
- Fault calibration is **Little's Law** (arrival rate × per-request hold time), not RPS — hold time is a first-class authored parameter; without it the fault may never fire at benchmark scales.
- Load generator is **open-loop** for this scenario (closed-loop self-throttles and the symptom never manifests) — resolves Q8 for the spike.
- Baseline logs must carry a **realistic noise floor** (sterile-clean baseline = grep-and-win).
- Reset = teardown + pristine PG volume until snapshot-resume is empirically validated (Q10 stays a named exit check).
- PRD backing-services wording (Postgres+RabbitMQ vs actual SUT stacks) must be reconciled in the v0.2 rewrite.

## D14 (2026-06-16) — One clean substrate + per-fault tasks; SRE repair model for code faults
**Decision:** Restructure the repo from *two parallel Harbor tasks* into **one correct system-under-test (the Slack clone) with faults injected per task**. The SREGym *discipline* (one substrate, many faults authored off it) producing the frontier-swe *runtime shape* (each task fully self-contained). Concretely: a `substrates/<name>/` (clean Slack-clone, deploys healthy by default), `tasks/<name>/<id>/` standard Harbor tasks generated from `scenarios/<name>/<id>`, and a shared `verifier/`. `pool-exhaustion-cyclical/` is **deleted** (redundant — its fault is reproduced by slack-clone 03-F1 on a richer substrate; redundant Compose backend).

**The load-bearing call — SRE repair model for code faults.** Our harness is operator-shell / live-system (SREGym-style), **not** source-editing (frontier-swe-style). Faults inject at three tiers matched to fault class: **Tier-1 config** (Helm values overlay — pool/timeout/replicas/DSN), **Tier-2 image** (an app-code patch baked into `slack-app:<id>@digest`, deployed as a bad version), **Tier-3 runtime** (post-install hook / `kubectl` mutation — cert expiry, bad config push, corruption). A Tier-2 *code* fault is **repaired by operator action — rollback / re-pin to the base image / config mitigation — never by editing source.** This keeps **one harness and one oracle**; we are explicitly NOT adding a SWE-style source-edit mode (that would be a second harness: operator isolation drops, verifier becomes diff/test-based). Tiers 2–3 also populate the *deep* end of the causal-distance axis (D1's lead claim), which a config overlay alone cannot reach.

**Why no runtime path-sharing:** verified in `harbor-src` that a Harbor task is strictly one directory (`chart_path`/`values_files` resolve under `<task>/environment/`). Sharing one chart across tasks via `../` escape works only because the helm backend runs against local host paths with zero validation — **non-standard and fragile, rejected.** DRY is achieved at *build/authoring time* via `tools/generate_tasks.py` (spec → self-contained task), not at runtime.

**Obligations created:**
- Build `tools/generate_tasks.py` (spec→task generator) and enforce the D7 anti-leak rule (uniform role-config key set) *in the generator*, once, not per scenario.
- Verifier moves to repo-level `verifier/` and reads a per-scenario `ground-truth.yaml` (was the single `oracle/manifest.yaml`).
- Tier-2 grading is a design extension (outcome=symptom cleared; attribution={service, image/version, mechanism}; minimality=rolled back to base image, no collateral) — implemented when the first code fault is authored. *(Discharged by D16: the Tier-2 image seam shipped as scenario `seq-lock-leak`.)*
- Substrate externalization to a git submodule is **phased/deferred**: in-repo restructure first (keep 03-F1 green), submodule + by-digest image publishing second.
- Re-prove the seam: generated `tasks/slack-spine/03-F1-pool-exhaustion` must reproduce oracle→1.0 / nop→0.0 through `harbor run -e helm`.

## D15 (2026-06-16) — Experimental controlled causal-distance ladder at 3/4/5

**Decision:** Add two controlled variants around 03-F1 while holding workload,
peak schedule, user SLO, observability tool catalog, episode budget, attribution
schema, soak, and deterministic grading constant. 03-F1 remains distance 3;
03-F1b moves ownership to Postgres `max_connections` at distance 4; 03-F1c adds
a real PgBouncer transaction-pool/queue at distance 5. No metric is hidden to
create distance.

**Status qualification:** both added variants are **experimental**. Generation,
Helm render, construct-validity, contract, verifier-unit, answer-key lint,
generic exploit-probe checks, and scenario-specific synthetic oracle checks are
green. As of 2026-06-21, local Docker/kind/Harbor execution is available after
raising Docker Desktop's VM memory to 7168 MiB, and the repo-level
`./validate.sh harbor` gate passes for the existing 03-F1 path (`PASS=3 FAIL=0`:
image rebuild, 03-F1 oracle PASS, 03-F1 nop FAIL). That gate does **not** execute
03-F1b or 03-F1c. Variant-specific Harbor oracle/nop behavior, repeated
calibration, and reward-hack trajectories are therefore still unverified. The
answer keys retain `thresholds.provisional: true`.

**Obligations created:**

- Run repeated healthy/faulted trials and publish effect-size, FP, and FN bands
  separately for each member before using a score-versus-distance curve.
- Revalidate Variant B's known latching/re-convergence risk; do not assume the
  03-F1 cyclical calibration transfers.
- Build and exercise the packaged PgBouncer image, authentication, queue
  behavior, logging, and SIGHUP reload path in kind.
- Execute wrong-layer, timeout, throttle/cache, broad-mutation, report-only,
  no-reload, restart-only, and post-declare-revert attacks through Harbor.
- Remove the experimental label only after oracle→PASS, nop→FAIL, adversarial
  failures, and repeated calibration all pass.

## D16 (2026-07-05) — Tier-2 image seam implemented (M3): dormant env-gated code path, operational-only repair
**Decision:** Author the Tier-2 (image) fault seam D14 reserved, refining its shape. D14 framed a Tier-2 fault as "a bad *version* image, deployed and re-pinned to base to repair." In practice the substrate ships ONE shared `slack-app` image carrying every fault behavior compiled-in DORMANT behind default-off env toggles (the `process.env.X` idiom already pervasive in `message.ts`); an image fault is a Helm overlay that activates one toggle via `app.roles.<role>.env.<FLAG>`, rendered ONLY into the Deployment container env — not agent-readable (no kubectl), not in the `app.yaml` minimality basis. So there is no per-fault image tag and no re-pin: the injection is env-activated immutable code, and — because the agent has no kubectl and `/admin` merges only `db.*` — the repair is **operational only** (an SQL/DB action that neutralizes the bug's effect while the code keeps running). This is D14's "config mitigation" repair path made concrete, and it reaches the deep end of the causal-distance axis (D1) a config overlay cannot.

**Implementation (multi-tier plan M3):**
- Generator un-stubbed: `generate_tasks._dispatch_tier_validator` routes `tier: image` to a substrate-owned `validate_image_tier` (confines the overlay to `app.roles.<role>.env`, requires each activated flag to be a REGISTERED dormant fault in `checks/dormant_faults.yaml`, asserts default-off byte-identical). The "image-diff basis" M3 originally imagined is unneeded — an env-activated fault with an SQL repair produces no config diff, so minimality passes vacuously and a cross-link gate does the correctness work.
- First fault **09-I1** (seq-row-lock leak): a dormant `HOLD_SEQ_LOCK` path holds a `channel_seq` row lock forever → pool exhaustion that MIMICS 03-W1 but whose pool-enlarge fix cannot help (a differential-diagnosis sibling of 03-W1). Repaired by `pg_terminate_backend` of the idle-in-transaction holder.
- New `oracle.lock_state` cross-link gate (mirrors `db_state`/`seq_integrity`): asserts no idle-in-transaction backend still holds a `channel_seq` lock — fences the pool-bump and pod-restart band-aids gate1 alone might not.

**Obligations created:**
- A Tier-2 fault needs an image RELEASE cycle: add the TS dormant path + a `dormant_faults.yaml` entry, bump `images.release`, `push_images`, regenerate. The TS source edit changes the SUT fingerprint, so ALL scenarios' calibrations decay to provisional until re-stamped (loud + expected).
- A cross-link correctness gate's probe must be wired into BOTH producers (host-verifier kubectl-exec + in-pod loadgen grader) or the unwired path fails loudly.

## D18 (2026-07-09) — `shell-visible` access surface: scoped exec into hardened app pods (diagnosis-only)
**Decision:** Implement the second access level from Design v0.5 §4 behind the existing `agent_surface` seam. `shell-visible` grants the agent **scoped `kubectl exec` into the SUT app pods** (read live in-pod state + the on-pod running code) on top of the `confined` base kit; the graded *repair* surface is unchanged (operational `/admin` config + privileged psql). The increment is a **diagnosis** surface, not a new mutation channel — so G1/G2/M and the CAPTURE basis are untouched.

Two structural rules make the grant safe (they ARE the LEAK/CAPTURE theory for this surface, enforced by validators, never review):
- **Hardened targets.** Every exec-reachable app pod is rendered with `securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` + `runAsNonRoot` + `automountServiceAccountToken: false`. Read-only rootfs means a shell **cannot persist an invisible on-pod mutation** (the CAPTURE guarantee: the only durable fix channels remain the captured `/admin`+psql ones); no SA token means the shell **cannot reach the k8s API** (no lateral escalation from an app pod).
- **No env-armed faults.** The whole point of `shell-visible` is exposing on-pod state, so any fault whose *arming* is visible in the pod (a container `env` var like `HOLD_SEQ_LOCK`, or the arming knob rendered into the mounted `/config/app.yaml`) would **name itself** to `kubectl exec … -- env`. `shell-visible` tasks are therefore admissible only for faults with no in-pod tell: the fault must be findable through behavior + on-pod *state*, not a self-naming toggle. A new admissibility validator + a LEAK probe over every exec-reachable pod's rendered env enforce this. (This is why D16's env-activated image faults are transitional scaffolding, and true-code-delta layers are the target Tier-2 style — a code delta is one path among thousands, not a greppable env line.)

The exec grant lives on the **foothold**, not the app pods: `main` gains a namespaced `pods/exec` Role + a mounted SA token + `kubectl` in its image, gated on the surface. The shelled pods stay credential-less and immutable. Harbor's single-`_main_pod` exec routing is unchanged — the agent execs *from* `main`, so no pinned-harbor change is needed.

**The exec/grader boundary (discovered in review, load-bearing).** `pods/exec` cannot be label-scoped — k8s RBAC scopes a subresource only by exact pod name (dynamic for Deployments), so a namespaced `pods/exec` Role reaches EVERY pod in the namespace, including the co-located **loadgen grader** (which holds BOTH the answer key AND the client-measured evidence `loadgen.jsonl`). An exec token there lets the agent read the key OR forge the evidence, defeating G2/G1. **CORRECTED BY D20:** this entry first proposed *grader-namespace isolation* — D20 shows that is insufficient (stops key-leak, not evidence-tamper) and unnecessary (`pods/exec` *name*-scopes via `resourceNames` once app pods have stable StatefulSet names; the loadgen stays an unlisted Deployment). The chosen enablement is **named-exec (D20 option A)**, not grader migration. **Consequence for THIS PR (unchanged):** it lands the HARDENING (the offline-safe CAPTURE guarantee) + the exec Role TEMPLATE (gated off) + the surface declaration; the generator does NOT flip exec on, and `leak_probe`'s `surface-exec-grader-isolation` invariant fails loudly for any exec-enabled task whose grader is still reachable — fencing the enablement until named-exec lands (D20).

**Obligations created:**
- App-pod hardening edits the shared chart (tier03 + any other exec-reachable tier), so `base_fingerprint` moves and every `confined` task's calibration decays to provisional until re-stamped (D16 pattern — loud + expected). The hardening is gated (`agentSurface.hardenAppPods`) so the DEFAULT render stays byte-identical and existing tasks re-generate unchanged.
- `leak_probe` becomes surface-aware: for a `shell-visible` task it asserts every exec-reachable pod carries the hardening flags, no rendered env names the fault, the foothold RBAC is narrow, AND (the new invariant) an exec grant cannot reach the grader.
- **Exec-enablement bundle (before a `shell-visible` task grants exec / flips `provisional: false`):** grader-namespace isolation; `kubectl` in the main image; then flip `agentSurface.exec.enabled`. A cleaner alternative to kubectl-exec is a scoped, read-only app-side debug endpoint (no k8s API, unreachable on the grader) — also a base-bump. Either way the app pods stay hardened.
- Non-root app pods are untested in the toy chart (KNOWN_LIMITATIONS); the hardening must carve out writable `emptyDir`/`tmpfs` for any path the service writes, proven in the `harbor` gate before a `shell-visible` task flips `provisional: false`.

## D19 (2026-07-09) — `build-capable` access surface: rebuild-in-place, NOT in-cluster image build (superseded mechanism)

> Historical design record. D21 keeps the source-repair semantics but supersedes
> D19's writable-workspace, persisted-`dist/`, Deployment restart, and app-served
> source-capture mechanism. The operational implementation is documented in
> [`AGENT-SURFACES.md`](AGENT-SURFACES.md).

**Decision:** Implement the fourth access level. `build-capable` grants **writable `/src` carrying the FAULTED source** + a scoped pipeline to **rebuild and redeploy exactly one Deployment**, so the graded work becomes a genuine *source* repair (remediate track, Design §8). This intentionally reopens D14's "explicitly NOT a SWE-style source-edit mode" — the owner's call (2026-07-09): `build-capable` IS the deliberate second repair semantics, added as a **third minimality basis** (source diff) rather than a second harness. One oracle, one grading plane; only the *capture basis* widens.

**The load-bearing mechanism call — rebuild-in-place, not kaniko.** Design v0.5 §4 speculated a kaniko/in-sandbox *image* build. The substrate map proves that is unnecessary and unproven net-new infra: the `slack-app` runtime image already ships the **full pnpm workspace + toolchain (node_modules, tsc) at `/build`**, and 09-I1's layer proves `cd /build && pnpm -r build` is a **thin, offline** rebuild. So `build-capable` = the app pod runs its code from a **writable per-Deployment volume seeded once from `/build`**; the agent edits the faulted source there, runs `pnpm -r build` in place, and `kubectl rollout restart`s the one Deployment via scoped RBAC (a fresh pod re-uses the already-seeded volume, so the rebuilt `dist/` persists). No in-cluster registry, no kaniko, no host build — the fix rebuilds compiled bytes the running image already knows how to run. (A future heavyweight kaniko path is possible if true in-episode image *immutability* is ever wanted; declined now as unproven and redundant.)

**CAPTURE (the one new anti-cheat piece).** A rebuilt `dist/` is invisible to the `/admin/config` snapshot, so a source edit would escape minimality. The fix reuses the basis-agnostic diff machinery: `oracle.minimality.diff_keys` already emits a `file:<relpath>` mutation key for any non-YAML byte diff. `build-capable` adds a **declare-time source snapshot** (parallel to `config_at_declare.json`): the app serves its watched source subtree at a private `/admin/source` endpoint, the loadgen snapshots it at declare into `source_at_declare.json`, and a shared `oracle.assemble` helper places FAULTED-source-before vs agent-edited-source-after into `config_before`/`config_after` as `file:` keys. `minimality.allowed_keys_by_component` then lists the source paths the fix may legitimately touch; redeploy-legitimacy falls out for free (a real source diff makes `config_changed` True, so the `rollout restart` is not read as restart-masking). Granularity is per-file today (diff_keys treats a file as one opaque key) — sub-file (hunk/AST) scoping is a future refinement.

**Scope split (what lands here vs the live spike).** The harness seam, per-surface validators, chart wiring (writable `/src` PVC + seed-once initContainer + scoped one-Deployment `rollout` Role), the CAPTURE oracle/loadgen machinery, the LEAK probes, and an example scenario are landed and **offline-green** (lint/generate/consistency/identity/provenance/probe). Two pieces genuinely require a live single-node cluster and are the remaining **Phase-1 feasibility spike**: (1) end-to-end proof that a `rollout restart` re-boots from the seed-once volume with the agent's rebuilt `dist/` under the read-only-elsewhere hardening, on both `-e helm` (kind) and `-e daytona` (k3s); (2) the app-side `/admin/source` endpoint (editing app TS forces an `images.release` bump, so it rides the next base cut alongside `code-visible`). Until (1)+(2) pass and `calibrate` shows FP=FN=0, a `build-capable` task stays `provisional: true` / `hosted_ready: false`.

**Obligations created:**
- Writable `/src` + scoped `apps/deployments` `rollout` Role are net-new chart objects, gated (`agentSurface.buildCapable.*`, default-off → byte-identical confined render). Same `base_fingerprint`/calibration decay as D18.
- `build-capable` is admissible ONLY on image-tier faults whose delta is source under `layer/<key>/` (config/runtime tiers ship no source). The admissibility validator enforces `fault.tier == image` + a source-carrying layer on the build-capable image key.
- The CAPTURE source snapshot must be wired into BOTH grading producers (host verifier + in-pod loadgen) sharing one `assemble` helper, or the unwired path fails loudly (D16 obligation).
- The exposed writable `/src` is FAULTED source handed to the agent — `lint_scenario`'s agent-visible surface must include it so `golden_fix`/`injected`/component/framing markers in the shipped source fail smoke (D2/D7 hygiene), and the LEAK probe asserts the `rollout` Role is scoped to exactly the one target Deployment (never cluster-wide, never `pods/exec` on foreign components).

## D20 (2026-07-09) — Exec-enablement: named-exec (StatefulSet + `resourceNames`), NOT grader migration
**Correction to D18.** D18 framed the exec blocker as "`pods/exec` reaches the loadgen answer key → isolate the grader's namespace." That is both **insufficient and unnecessary**, and it conflated the two things D9 isolates:

1. **The answer key (LEAK).** `ground-truth.yaml` + `config_before`, mounted at `/grader-key` in loadgen.
2. **The client-measured evidence (TAMPER).** `/grader/loadgen.jsonl` — the per-request, phase-labeled records G1 grades, accumulated *continuously through the episode* (the fault only exists under load; the evidence IS the history).

**Why grader migration fails.** Moving verdict computation out of the cluster (the host-side verifier already exists — `substrate.yaml:host_import_path`, used by `validate.sh harbor` + `calibrate` via `--verifier-import-path`) solves LEAK-of-key but NOT TAMPER-of-evidence: with `pods/exec` into loadgen, the agent rewrites `loadgen.jsonl` mid-episode so faulted phases read healthy, fixes nothing, and declares — an outside grader faithfully grades the forgery. Revoke-at-declare doesn't help (forgery precedes declare). So the invariant is stricter and simpler than "isolate the grader namespace": **`pods/exec` must never reach the loadgen pod, full stop, regardless of where the verdict runs.** (Verdict location is a separate, orthogonal, *hosted-compatibility* question — stock Harbor on Oddish only runs `tests/test.sh` polling `/grader/verdict`, so host-side verdict re-opens D14's stock-Harbor property. Late-key-injection — spawn the key/verdict only after the declare handler revokes RBAC — is defense-in-depth on the key, not a fix for evidence.)

**Why grader migration is unnecessary — `resourceNames` name-scopes `pods/exec`.** D18's "RBAC can't scope `pods/exec`, Deployment pods have random suffixes" is only half true: RBAC can't *label*-scope a subresource, but it *name*-scopes fine. Give the app roles **stable pod names** (StatefulSets: `svc-message-0`, …) and grant `pods get` + `pods/exec create` with `resourceNames: [svc-message-0, …]` — an exact-name allowlist (no `list`; that verb ignores `resourceNames`, and the agent knows the names by convention). The loadgen stays a random-suffix **Deployment**, unlisted → unreachable. No grader-namespace migration, no cross-ns DNS ripple, in-pod grading untouched.

**Decision — the exec-enablement menu (ranked by delta-from-current):**
- **A. Named-exec** (StatefulSet naming + `resourceNames` RBAC): kills the blocker directly; key AND evidence protected; in-pod grading + stock-Harbor hosted flow untouched. Cost: chart churn (Deployment→StatefulSet), StatefulSet rollout semantics, and it still needs kubectl in `main` + the clean-source lint. **The cheapest true exec — chosen as primary.**
- **B. Debug-endpoint** (scoped read-only app-side inspection, no k8s credential): grader unreachable by construction. Cost: not a real shell (weaker realism claim), every inspection capability hand-built. **Kept as fallback** if StatefulSet conversion turns up ugly rollout-restart interactions.
- **C. Outside / late-key grader**: correct as *defense-in-depth on top of A* (key out-of-cluster even if RBAC is misconfigured), but insufficient alone (evidence tamper) and the only option that touches hosted stock-Harbor compatibility. **NOT the primary fix.**

**Obligations created:**
- **The one live spike, first:** StatefulSet stable names + `kubectl rollout restart` + the build-capable seed-once PVC composing together (does a named StatefulSet pod re-boot from the retained PVC with the agent's rebuilt `dist/`?). Spike this before authoring; if it's ugly, fall back to B.
- When named-exec lands, `leak_probe`'s `surface-exec-grader-isolation` evolves from the namespace check to assert the `pods/exec` rule is `resourceNames`-scoped, that the set EXCLUDES the loadgen pod name, and that it covers only the intended app pods (the current namespace check would false-positive on a correctly name-scoped Role).
- Shared prerequisite (every option): the base app source must be framing-scrubbed — `leak_probe`'s `surface-source-exposure-clean` already fences this (it fails once a task exposes source while `roles/message.ts` still says "the 03-F1 fault site"). This is the code-visible clean-source work.
- kubectl in the `main` image (or the B debug-endpoint), an `images.release` bump.

## D21 (2026-07-09) — Named exec and trusted source-only rebuild implemented

**Decision:** Complete D20 option A. Surface-enabled app roles are one-replica
StatefulSets with per-role headless Services. Main receives exact-name pod get/exec
RBAC; no list/watch/wildcard/loadgen access exists. kubectl v1.32.2 is downloaded
with its release checksum and client-checked during the main image build.

**Correction to D19:** build-capable does not persist a writable workspace or
compiled output. Only `services/app/src` lives on the PVC. On every boot a trusted
init container copies immutable `/build` into a fresh `emptyDir`, links the PVC
source, and runs bundled offline tsc. The runtime is mounted read-only. A grader-owned
read-only PVC mount captures bounded source trees before access, at declaration,
and after soak; missing/unsafe snapshots and any post-declare source drift fail closed.

**Live validation status:** The permanent Blacksmith `agent-surface-contract`
workflow proves the real single-node kind contract: exact-name exec allowed,
loadgen exec and pod listing denied, stable-name pod replacement, PVC source
persistence, successful trusted compilation, and visible/non-zero compilation
failure. This resolves D20's kind feasibility spike. It does not resolve the
release gate: Blacksmith/kind calibration still requires golden `3/3 PASS` /
nop `3/3 FAIL`, while the final hosted merge gate requires one Daytona
experiment containing oracle 1/1, nop 1/1, and five completed GLM 5p2 trials
with a mean reward in `(0.00, 0.60]` before either surface is declared
hosted-ready.

## D22 (2026-07-15) — Generated tasks are committed, inspectable runtime units

**Decision:** Keep D14's self-contained Harbor runtime unit and commit one complete task
per hosted scenario. `substrates/` and `scenarios/` remain the authored source;
`tools.generate_tasks` stamps `tasks/<substrate>/<id>/`, and `--check` creates temporary
trees and compares their complete contents with the committed tasks.

The sole answer key and `config_before` are ordinary files inside the committed chart
and are loaded verbatim with Helm `.Files.Get`. One `task.values.yaml` carries fault,
access, grading-harness, and pinned-image settings without duplicate YAML keys. Published
tasks remain fully self-contained, so D14's
rejection of runtime `../` path sharing and symlinks still stands.

**Obligations created:**
- `generate_tasks --check` proves deterministic full-tree generation, task/index sync,
  and orphan detection without mutating committed output.
- Every execution entry point consumes `tasks/<substrate>/<id>` directly.
- Reviewers can inspect the exact executed evaluator at `tests/oracle/`; loadgen collects
  evidence but cannot make outcome, attribution, minimality, or reward decisions.

## D23 (2026-07-15) — Declaration is a terminal, agent-free grading boundary

**Decision:** The first accepted incident report is final. Loadgen locks the report and
captures submission state, returns an instruction for the agent to exit, then asynchronously
asks a root `agent-freezer` sidecar to terminate and continuously reap every UID 10001 process.
The soak begins only after the freezer acknowledges that no agent-owned process remains and a
second snapshot proves shutdown caused no state mutation.

The freezer shares the main pod's process namespace, carries only `CAP_KILL`, and has an
authenticated internal service. Its capability Secret is mounted only into loadgen, freezer,
and the root verifier view. The agent cannot read the capability, `tests/oracle/`, the answer
key, or the finalized evidence bundle. A forced kill is evidence, not an infrastructure
failure; authentication, snapshot, or freeze failures end the episode without starting soak.

Loadgen owns timing, report handling, probes, snapshots, and protected evidence assembly. It
never imports `oracle.evaluate` and never produces a verdict or reward. Root-only
`tests/test.sh` polls the documented readiness response, fetches the finalized bundle, and
runs the exact evaluator committed at `tests/oracle/`. Declared runs fail closed without a
successful boundary receipt or when submission and post-freeze snapshots differ.

**Scope:** Processes deliberately daemonized earlier through direct remote `kubectl exec`
remain outside this pod process boundary. Existing drift, restart, minimality, and source
attestation gates cover that threat until an exec broker is introduced.

**Supersedes:** D20's verdict-location conclusion and all descriptions of loadgen as an
in-pod grader. D20's named-exec isolation remains useful defense in depth for loadgen evidence.

## D24 (2026-08-21) — Calibration is artifact-only; the fence gates, the stamp replays
**Decision:** The CI calibration engine never writes bands back to the PR branch —
`write_back` is a deprecated safety tripwire, and the aggregate job only re-grades the
captured rundirs with the real oracle (#266). What makes that safe rather than advisory
is #279: the reporting path now evaluates calibration policy v2 unconditionally (a nop
must fail a *semantic* discriminator, not just the report checks) and `calibrate`
returns non-zero on a failed fence, so a red fence is a red check run and the PR
comment (posted under `always()`) names the policy-v2 reason. A **passed** fence is
closed into the spec afterwards by replaying its captured rundirs offline —
`calibrate --no-run --write` — which stamps bands + `calibration:` provenance and
flips `provisional: false` from the same bytes, spending no new trials (#266, #282).

**Obligations created:**
- A stamp is sound only while no fingerprint-bearing path moved since the fence;
  the check asks the fingerprint exclusion set, never a path-level diff (#266).
- `hosted_ready` stays a separate promotion gate (a current qualification lock,
  #222); calibration provenance alone must never flip it.

## D25 (2026-10-07) — Reconstruction: Incident Arena output is the reference
**Decision:** The original repository went offline; its last generated output (the
20 Incident Arena tasks, `abundant-ai/incident-arena@fba011e`) is the reference this
fork must reproduce. `./validate.sh arena` (tools/arena_parity.py) checks every
regenerated Arena task byte-for-byte, with each tolerated difference listed and
justified in `ALLOWED_DIFFERENCES`. The v2 verifier lives at `verifier/` (the
recovered `closure.py` names that root) and ships as `tests/verifier/`; completion is
the declaration (`declare_repair_complete`), the report is advisory; load profiles of
window-anchored tasks are derived from `task.metadata.agent_window_s`/`soak_s`.
**Why:** with the source history gone after 2026-09-19, generated outputs and the
published images are the only primary evidence; a byte-level gate turns
"reconstructed" into a checkable claim instead of a judgment call.
**Obligations:** keep the gate green; record unrecoverable pieces in
`docs/plans/tech-debt.md`; see `docs/plans/2026-10-07-arena-parity.md`.

## D13 (2026-06-08) — Consolidate to a single self-contained Harbor task
> Superseded by D14: `pool-exhaustion-cyclical` was deleted; the repo is now one `substrates/<name>/` + per-fault generated `tasks/<name>/<id>` (authored from `scenarios/<name>/<id>`), and `validate.sh` targets are now lint/contracts/stamp/render/harbor (observe/adversarial/calibrate retired). D13's single-source-of-truth-per-task lesson carries into the stamped-task model.

**Decision:** Harbor is *the* framework; collapse everything into **one self-contained task** at the repo root, `pool-exhaustion-cyclical/`, and delete the parallel local harness. The triggering complaint: the repo carried two front-ends over one substrate (local `harness/`+`infra/` AND the Harbor task), the substrate (`sut`/`loadgen`/`oracle`) lived apart from the task that used it (forcing `context: ../../..` and a `PYTHONPATH=spike/` trick), and the faulted config was triplicated.

**What moved (git mv, history preserved):** the task left `spike/harbor-task/pool-exhaustion/` for repo-root `pool-exhaustion-cyclical/`; the SUT (`sut/app`→`environment/app`) and load generator (`loadgen`→`environment/loadgen`) moved *inside* `environment/`; the grader (`oracle`→`verifier/oracle`) moved *inside* `verifier/`. Result: build `context: .`, the verifier imports `oracle` from one local dir (`PYTHONPATH=<task>/verifier`), no cross-tree references. `spike/` is gone.

**Single source of truth for the fault:** the faulted config now lives only at `environment/config/app.yaml` — the Dockerfile `COPY`s it and the verifier reads it for `config_before` (previously triplicated across the Dockerfile `printf`, a hardcoded `_FAULTED_APP_CONFIG`, and `sut/config/app.yaml`).

**Local-harness capabilities PORTED first (nothing lost):**
- **Answer-key lint** → `tools/lint_scenario.py`, retargeted to the agent-visible surface inside `main` (`environment/{app,config,start-main.sh,restart-app.sh}`). `validate.sh lint`.
- **Adversarial validation** → `solution/variants/{overprovision,ratelimit,timeoutbump,cache}.sh`, each run as the OracleAgent via `harbor run -a oracle` by swapping it into `solution/solve.sh`, asserting `overall=FAIL`. NOTE: Harbor's minimality diffs only `app.yaml` (no compose), so `overprovision` was redefined to violate via an out-of-allowlist key (`db.hold_ms`) rather than the old compose `mem_limit`/`max_connections` edits.
- **Calibration** → `tools/calibration_analysis.py` (pure band/FP-FN/effect fns, lifted verbatim) + `tools/calibrate_harbor.py` (drives `-a oracle -k N` on a no-declare `calib-golden` variant + `-a nop -k M`, harvests each trial's `verifier/rundir/loadgen.jsonl`, writes `calibration/band.json`). `validate.sh calibrate`.

**Deleted:** `spike/harness/`, `spike/infra/`, the local `CONTRACTS.md`, the `spike/` wrapper; trimmed `pyproject.toml` (`anthropic`/`pydantic` were agent/judge-only). `validate.sh` rewritten (`lint`/`observe`/`harbor`/`adversarial`/`calibrate`; `local` removed). `CONTRACTS_HARBOR.md` → the task's `CONTRACTS.md`.

**Verification gate:** `validate.sh harbor` (oracle→PASS, nop→FAIL) re-proves the end-to-end pipeline after the move — image builds with the new local contexts and the verifier importing its vendored oracle.

## D12 (2026-06-08) — Remove the LLM mechanism judge: the verifier is fully deterministic
**Decision:** Strip the optional LLM mechanism judge (`oracle/judge.py`, `--llm-judge`, `USE_LLM_JUDGE`) out of the grading path entirely. The oracle/verifier is now a pure deterministic function `evaluate_run(run_dir) → verdict`: **Gate 1** (numeric thresholds over client-measured load/metrics), **Gate 2** (exact service+component match vs a closed registry), and **minimality** (config-key set-diff). Mechanism stays as a **keyword** score — pure string ops, reported, **never gating**.

**Why:** The benchmark's headline is *clean, static, white-box grading* (FP=FN=0.000). Any LLM in the verifier — even non-gating — invites the "your grader is an LLM" critique, is non-reproducible / version-drifts / is promptable, and gets read as part of the score no matter how loudly it's labeled "non-gating." The judge was already non-gating and its own FP/FN was never measured (a deferred obligation), so it bought nothing while carrying that cost. Removing it makes "the verifier is static and gradable" true with no asterisk and makes **every grading run API-free**.

**Behavior-preserving:** the D11 PASS already ran on the keyword path (because `USE_LLM_JUDGE=1` never propagated to the verifier). Regression: re-running `oracle.evaluate` on the D11 run dir after the change yields a **byte-identical verdict** (overall PASS, `gate2.mechanism.method=keyword`, score 0.75).

**Why NOT promote mechanism into the static gate (a closed enum, like service/component):** an enumerated list of root-cause mechanisms would telegraph the answer. Mechanism stays free-text + non-gating for **leak-resistance**; if mechanism-quality analysis is ever wanted it is done out-of-band, never inside `evaluate_run`.

**Changes:** deleted `oracle/judge.py`; dropped `use_llm`/`--llm-judge` from `oracle.evaluate` + `oracle.attribution`; dropped `_use_llm_judge` and the `[verifier.env]` `USE_LLM_JUDGE` from the Harbor verifier + `task.toml`; dropped `--llm-judge` from `harness.episode`; removed `USE_LLM_JUDGE` from `validate.sh`; updated `.env.example`, both READMEs, `CONTRACTS.md`, `CONTRACTS_HARBOR.md`, and `archive/SPIKE.md §5/§9`.

**Supersedes:** the D11 follow-up ("wire `USE_LLM_JUDGE` into the verifier env") — now moot. Closes the archive/SPIKE.md §9 deferred item "mechanism-judge FP/FN measurement."

## D11 (2026-06-08) — First clean end-to-end agent run: PASS through the full stack
**Result:** `claude-opus-4-8` (real claude-code agent) ran through the Harbor task with the full
7-service stack and **PASSED all gates** (gate1/gate2/minimality/reward = 1.0). The first
leak-free agent-capability datapoint (the original spike agent run was contaminated; everything
changed underneath it since).

**What it did (genuinely good incident response):** investigated **via the MCP observability tools**
(14 `obs-mcp` tool calls — PromQL + LogQL, not `cat`). Diagnosed from telemetry: cited
`db_pool_capacity=5`, `db_pool_checked_out` saturated, `db_pool_wait_seconds` p99 ~1.98s pegged at
the timeout, `app_requests_total{status="pool_timeout"}` rising — and **ruled out Postgres via Loki**
("postgres logs clean, max_connections=100, so the DB was not the constraint"). Did the Little's-law
math itself. Fixed (`pool_size=50/max_overflow=30`, confined to `app.db_pool` → minimality PASS),
verified under load, filed an exact structured report (service=api-app, component=app.db_pool).

**Cost/timing:** $0.80, 602k input / 547k cache / 7.6k output tokens, 7m34s. Declared at t=330.8s
(5.5 min) — **validates D8/the demo profile**: with the `dev` profile (150s deadline) the loadgen
would have null-pathed before the agent declared → spurious FAIL. The `demo` profile (690s, dev-scale
load, added this session) held load through the agent's investigation.

**Minor honest gap:** the LLM mechanism judge did NOT run — `USE_LLM_JUDGE=1` didn't propagate to the
host-side verifier's env resolution; mechanism was scored by the keyword fallback (0.75, non-gating,
passed). The PASS is valid regardless (mechanism is non-gating per D6; Gate 2 passes on exact
service+component match). Follow-up: ~~wire USE_LLM_JUDGE into the verifier env~~ — **superseded by
D12: the LLM judge was removed instead; the verifier is now fully deterministic.**

## D10 (2026-06-08) — Real observability stack (Prometheus/Loki) + MCP query tools
> Updated by D14: the substrate is now a single Slack-clone Helm chart on the helm backend (kind/k3d per trial); the 7-service Compose obs layout is superseded — the observability/MCP design carries into `substrates/slack-spine/`.

**Decision (after verifying peer benchmarks):** the agent observes via a real telemetry backend queried through a fixed MCP tool catalog — the SREGym model — NOT by catting log files (which nobody does; see [[observability-design-peer-benchmarks]]). Backend is non-negotiable (real aggregator); interface = thin MCP query wrapper.

**Built (`harbor-task/pool-exhaustion/observe/`):** Prometheus (scrapes `main:8000/metrics`, PromQL), Loki + Promtail (Promtail tails the existing `/obs/logs/*.log` files → Loki; the centralized files became the SOURCE, the agent's INTERFACE became LogQL), and an `obs-mcp` FastMCP sidecar exposing `query_metrics(promql)`, `query_logs(logql)`, `list_metrics`, `list_log_labels`. Folded into the task's `environment/docker-compose.yaml` (7 services total) + `[[environment.mcp_servers]]` in task.toml. instruction.md observability surface rewritten to the MCP tools.

**Gating unknown resolved (grounded in harbor-src):** the agent's MCP client runs INSIDE `main` (claude-code writes MCP config and runs via `docker compose exec main`), so the MCP server is a compose SIDECAR reached at `http://obs-mcp:8000/mcp` over compose DNS — transport `streamable-http`, NO host ports. `main` depends_on `obs-mcp` healthy. Multi-container MCP requires the docker provider (not E2B/Daytona/Modal) — relevant for the E2B-phase direction.

**Validated API-free:** brought the full stack up — Prometheus scrapes the SUT (`db_pool_checked_out` queryable, shows saturation under load); Loki aggregates both `app`+`postgres` streams via Promtail; the MCP tool functions work (`query_metrics` returns trending series, `query_logs '{service="app"} |= "pool"'` filters correctly). `oracle` → PASS / (`nop` pending) through Harbor with all 7 services — grading unaffected.

**Still UNVALIDATED (needs a real agent / API call):** the agent actually *using* the MCP tools over the protocol. oracle/nop run scripts and don't call MCP tools, so the agent-investigates-via-MCP path is only exercised by a real claude-code run. Properties preserved: observability is read-only Prometheus/Loki (agent can game app-reported `/metrics` but not the client-measured grading signals on the private grader volume — [[grading-isolation-peer-benchmarks]]).

## D9 (2026-06-07) — Centralized logging + tamper-resistant grader split (Harbor task)
> Updated by D14: the substrate is now a single Slack-clone Helm chart on the helm backend (kind/k3d per trial); the Compose shared-volume `obs`/`grader` split is superseded — the grader-isolation design carries into `substrates/slack-spine/`.

**Trigger:** Andre asked why the agent (shelled into `main`) couldn't see the Postgres logs. Root cause: Postgres logged to its own container; `/shared` was only mounted in `main`+`loadgen`. Surfaced a second, worse issue: `/shared` (rw in `main`, where the agent has a ROOT shell) also held the grader's own inputs (`loadgen.jsonl`, `metrics.jsonl`, `episode_done.json`) — an adversarial agent could `ls /shared`, write a fake `episode_done.json` + fake-healthy `loadgen.jsonl`, and score PASS without fixing. Naively centralizing logs onto `/shared` would have made that hole *more* discoverable.

**Decision:** split the single `/shared` volume into two, which fixes both at once:
- **`obs`** (agent-facing): `/obs/logs/app.log`, `/obs/logs/postgres.log`, `/obs/incident_report.json`. Mounted rw in `main`+`postgres` (they write logs), **ro** in `loadgen` (reads the report). The agent reads both logs here — the observability surface is now explicit and held constant.
- **`grader`** (private): `loadgen.jsonl`, `metrics.jsonl`, `meta.json`, `episode_done.json`. Mounted rw in **`loadgen` only** — NOT in `main`, so the agent's root shell cannot read or forge the grading inputs. The host-side verifier reads them via `docker exec`/`docker cp` into the loadgen container, found by the compose project label derived from `environment.session_id`.

**Why it's robust:** the authoritative grading signals (latency/goodput/error-rate) are **client-measured by the load generator** and live only on `grader`. An agent can edit the app to fake its `/metrics` (the pool-wait gauge), but cannot fake the client-measured latency/goodput without actually serving the load correctly — i.e. actually fixing it. Postgres logs centralize via an entrypoint wrapper (`sh -c "mkdir -p /obs/logs && chmod 0777 /obs/logs && exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres -c logging_collector=on -c log_directory=/obs/logs ..."`) so the postgres user can write to the shared mount.

**Note:** for Variant A, Postgres is healthy, so its log correctly shows nothing alarming — the agent that checks it and concludes "DB is fine, problem is app-side" is reasoning correctly. The centralized DB log becomes load-bearing for Variant B (the `max_connections` breach, where `FATAL: too many clients` is the key signal).

## D8 (2026-06-07) — Harbor port works; the scenario maps cleanly onto Harbor
> Updated by D14: the substrate is now a single Slack-clone Helm chart on the helm backend (kind/k3d per trial); the docker-provider `main`+sibling-containers+shared-volumes mapping is superseded — the oracle/observability/grader-isolation design carries into `substrates/slack-spine/`.

**Decision:** Ported the validated spike into a real Harbor task (`spike/harbor-task/pool-exhaustion/`) and proved it end-to-end: golden (`-a oracle`) → **PASS** (gate1/gate2/minimality/reward all 1.0) through Harbor's own pipeline + our custom verifier. The "live multi-container + background-load + custom-Python-oracle" shape — unusual for Harbor — fits without forcing it into a test.sh.

**The mapping (verified against Harbor source, runs locally via the installed `harbor` CLI):**
- SUT app runs in Harbor's hardcoded `main` service (where the agent's `environment.exec()` lands); `postgres` + a `loadgen` sidecar are siblings; shared named volume `/shared`.
- Agent "declares" by writing `/shared/incident_report.json`; the loadgen sidecar watches for it, runs the soak, writes `episode_done.json`.
- Grading = a host-side custom `BaseVerifier` that polls `episode_done.json`, downloads `/shared` + `/config/app.yaml` from the live env, assembles a spike run-dir, and calls the **existing** `oracle.evaluate.evaluate_run` (zero oracle logic duplicated). Returns `VerifierResult(rewards=...)`.
- Golden = `solution/solve.sh` run by Harbor's OracleAgent; null = Harbor's NopAgent.

**Gotchas learned (save the next person hours):**
1. `Task.is_valid_dir()` requires `tests/test.sh` to EXIST even when using a custom verifier — else Harbor silently treats the dir as an empty dataset ("Either datasets or tasks must be provided"). Ship a no-op `tests/test.sh` stub; `VerifierFactory` picks `import_path` ahead of it.
2. **`import_path` is a JOB/TRIAL-level field, NOT a task.toml `[verifier]` field.** task.toml `[verifier]` only has network/timeout/env/environment_mode. Pass the verifier via CLI `--verifier-import-path module:Class` (task-dir name has a hyphen → top-level import, no dotted path), with PYTHONPATH = task `verifier/` + `spike/`.
3. `harbor run` prompts to confirm host-env access when `[verifier.env]` references host vars → pass `--yes` for unattended runs.
4. Custom verifiers must RETURN `VerifierResult`, never write reward.txt (that's the built-in verifier's path).

**Open (port-specific, not blocking):** (a) loadgen sidecar runs on its own clock — for a *real* long-running agent the schedule must hold load until declare rather than racing `declare_deadline_s` (fine for oracle/nop; fix before a real-agent Harbor run). (b) network isolation of loadgen from `main` is convention-level here (no docker socket in `main`); kernel-level is the E2B/k8s hardening.

**Closed on PR #6 review:** golden `solve.sh` can still repair and declare during warmup, but the loadgen now records the early `declare_ts_s` separately from `soak_start_s` and floors the graded soak at `warmup_s`. That removes the cold-pool false failure Andre observed without inserting artificial sleeps into the golden scripts.

## D7 (2026-06-07) — Answer-key lint is a validation gate (incident-driven)
**Incident:** the spike's first agent episode was contaminated — `sut/config/app.yaml` shipped with `# FAULTED. golden fix: 16` comments (plus "fault site" / oracle-design narration in `db.py`, `main.py`, `compose.yaml`) copied verbatim from the build contract into agent-visible artifacts. The agent under test read them on turn 2: detection was authentic (it cited real telemetry), but localization and fix values were open-book. The harness exit criteria are unaffected; the agent-capability datapoint is invalidated.

**Decision:** every scenario must pass an **answer-key lint** before any episode runs: scan all agent-visible artifacts for fault markers, golden values, oracle/anti-cheat references, and benchmark framing (`spike/harness/lint_scenario.py`, wired into `run_episode` — fails loudly). This extends D2's gate-3: "no reachable known-good reference" now includes *no in-band annotations*. Degenerate-fix emulation knobs renamed to production-plausible names (`MAX_INFLIGHT_REQUESTS`, `RESPONSE_CACHE_ENABLED`).

**Current enforcement:** the answer-key lint now runs through `./validate.sh lint` and is included in `./validate.sh smoke` and CI. Direct task runs, calibration, and hosted trials do not invoke it automatically; callers must run the validation gate first.

**Lesson for the benchmark:** spec-to-artifact contamination is a leak channel nobody red-teamed — scenario-authoring tooling itself must be treated as part of the threat model. For the library phase: generate scenario artifacts and grading manifests from separate sources, and lint at gate-validation time.

## D6 (2026-06-06) — Oracle v0.2: cross-linked dual-gate, report-as-action, frozen soak
**Decision:** Concretizes D3 after a 3-reviewer red-team (24 findings, 14 high). The dictated attribution rubric — (1) outcome metrics recover, (2) the agent's reasoning demonstrably fingered the pool — is implemented as:
1. **Outcome gate = server-side conjunction:** P99-vs-load in golden band through dwell+soak ∧ bounded error rate ∧ **goodput ≥ (1−tol)×offered RPS** (replaces the generator-liveness invariant, which a server-side throttle/cache defeats) ∧ pool-saturation signal ≈ 0 at peak (so "slow but completing" still fails).
2. **Attribution gate = the structured report**, submitted via an explicit `submit_incident_report(service, component, mechanism, evidence_refs)` tool (agent-neutral; schema forbids enumerations). service+component = exact match vs a **closed component registry published to the agent**; mechanism = LLM-judge **partial credit only** until judge FP/FN is measured.
3. **Cross-link (the load-bearing fix):** a minimality/blast-radius predicate over the config diff is wired INTO the gate — mutated keys must be confined to the attributed component. Without it, the red-team showed shotgun-overprovision + reverse-engineered attribution passes both gates and D3's anti-overprovisioning claim is false.
4. **Trajectory/reasoning-chain inspection is a reported research metric, never a gate** — gating on it violates "grade outcome, not procedure," is non-comparable across harnesses (trace-verbosity artifact), and rewards hypothesis spam. ⚠️ *This modulates Andre's dictated intent (reasoning-chain inspection as the key signal) — flagged for veto; the report gate captures the same fact agent-neutrally.*
5. **Episode termination:** agent declares resolved → frozen (zero token spend) → soak (1 full load cycle) → verdict computed once, never pollable. Telemetry stays visible (the SRE view); the oracle verdict and baseline curve do not. Time-to-declaration reported as tie-break.
6. **Scoring map:** the report *instantiates* Detection(filed)/Localization(fields)/Diagnosis(mechanism); Remediation = outcome gate only; headline = conjunction — kills the D3 double-counting risk. **Detection dropped as a scored stage in v1** (degenerate without no-fault controls; controls deferred to v2 as a detection-ROC contribution) — resolves Q5.

---

## Still open (by resolution path)

**Resolved by D5/D6 (2026-06-06):**
- ~~Q4~~ — durable-fix pass/fail headline; agent-declared termination + frozen soak; time-to-declaration as reported tie-break (D6.5)
- ~~Q5~~ — Detection dropped as scored stage in v1; no-fault controls + ROC deferred to v2 (D6.6)
- ~~Q8~~ — open-loop mandated for the spike scenario; closed-loop requires separate re-validation (D5)
- Q13 — *mechanism* resolved (hard step/token cap sized so an exhaustive knob-sweep cannot complete; cost reported); *value* set from spike's golden-trajectory measurement
- Q18 — *partially* resolved (effect-size-must-clear-noise hard gate + adversarial oracle validation as Phase-0 exit criteria); the budget-ceiling kill criterion still needs a number once cost is measured

**Resolvable by design work (no code needed):**
- Q6 — agent topology + enforcement of the hidden boundary (archive/SPIKE.md asserts the namespacing; enforcement audit unwritten)
- Q14 — toolset freeze point (the `submit_incident_report` tool is now part of the surface — freezing it pre-agent-runs per Q14's own logic argues for end-of-Phase-2)
- Q16 — definition of "seed"; repeats budget
- Q17 — contamination model (private split + rotation cadence)
- Q12 — vendoring strategy *decision* (registry, digest pinning)

**Resolvable only by spike evidence:**
- Q9 — measured noise budget; oracle FP/FN rate (now has a concrete N=10/M=10 design — archive/SPIKE.md §8.2)
- Q10 — snapshot-resume health vs teardown-reseed (named exit check — archive/SPIKE.md §7)
- Q11 — expressibility matrix numbers (footprint, reset time per substrate)
- Q13/Q18 — the constants (cap value, cost ceiling)
