"""values_gate — ONE gate for "the scenario's settings actually take effect".

A scenario can author a knob that nothing reads, and every existing gate passes
it. The spec is valid YAML, the schema accepts it, `helm template` renders, the
task deploys — at COMPILED DEFAULTS. The authored setting silently does nothing
and the task is graded as though it did something.

Three shapes of that defect, all hard errors here:

  inert-knob    a `difficulty.values` leaf key that appears NOWHERE in the
                substrate — no template, no values.yaml, no application source.
                The task deploys at the chart default. 13-P1-distractor-volume-shell
                is the live instance: its premise is log volume and its entire
                noise configuration is inert (see WAIVERS).

  phantom-fault a `faultInit.*` sub-key that is declared and schema-VALIDATED but
                rendered by zero templates. This is the worst one: the fault is
                never injected, so the environment DEPLOYS HEALTHY and the agent
                is graded on repairing a system that was never broken. Today
                `faultInit.roleGuc` (slack-spine — fully validated by
                substrates/slack-spine/checks/fault_validators.py, rendered by
                nothing) and `faultInit.lockState` (frappe — declared in
                chart/values.yaml:375, rendered by nothing) are both live traps
                waiting for the first scenario to author on them.

  v1-grading    a ground-truth.yaml with no `verification: {version: 2}` block.
                generate_tasks rejects a block that is PRESENT with the wrong
                version, but an ABSENT block is legal and silently selects v1
                grading. A v1 task injects, grades and passes its reference run
                perfectly while producing cohorts that cannot be counted, because
                the validity rule requires v2. Everything looks right and the
                measurement is worthless.

  declared-only (advisory) a key whose only appearance is a values.yaml default,
                with nothing reading it. A weaker form of inert-knob. Fires on
                nothing today; it is the early warning for the next one.

HOW "APPEARS SOMEWHERE" IS DECIDED
----------------------------------
The scan is by BARE KEY NAME over a deliberately WIDE corpus, because the three
times this check has been got wrong, it was got wrong by looking in too few
places. Each of these is a real instance found while building this gate:

  1. `chart/templates/**` misses SUBCHARTS. frappe renders through
     chart/charts/erpnext/templates/, so a naive glob calls `replicaCount` —
     set by 145 scenarios — inert.
  2. Unpacked subcharts miss PACKAGED ones. frappe's `extraFlags` is rendered
     only by chart/charts/erpnext/charts/mariadb-11.5.7.tgz, a gzipped tarball
     no text glob opens.
  3. The substrate tree misses the GENERATOR. tools/generate_tasks.py
     `_apply_task_chart_overrides` patches three slack-spine knobs
     (`enableServiceLinks`, `readinessProbeTimeoutSeconds`,
     `useServiceEnvironment`) into each task's OWN chart copy at stamping time,
     leaving the shared substrate chart byte-identical. All three are wired and
     provably effective — `tasks/slack-spine/06-F4-maintenance-collision/
     environment/chart/templates/main.yaml` ships `enableServiceLinks: false` —
     yet none appears anywhere under substrates/.

So the corpus is: the WHOLE substrate tree (subcharts unpacked and packaged),
plus loadgen-common/, plus tools/generate_tasks.py. Including the generator
whole is deliberate: it can mask a key the generator merely VALIDATES without
wiring, but the opposite error hard-fails a legitimate scenario mid-generation,
and a gate that cries wolf gets switched off. test_values_gate.py pins all three
mechanisms above so none can regress.

The scan is therefore a FLOOR, not a ceiling. A bare-name match anywhere counts,
so an incidental collision reads as wired — `app.logging.noiseSeed` on 13-P1 is
exactly that: it is spared only because `substrates/slack-spine/go/internal/
servicekit/noise.go` happens to declare `const noiseSeed = 7`, an unrelated Go
constant. Every key this gate reports is inert; not every inert key is reported.
Erring this way keeps false hard failures at zero.
