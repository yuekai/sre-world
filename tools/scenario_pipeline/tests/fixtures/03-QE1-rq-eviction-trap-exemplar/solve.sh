# Golden trajectory for the OracleAgent: the minimal, correct, targeted fix.
#
# Runs in the `main` operator-shell pod (exactly where a real agent's exec lands).
# The agent cannot edit files inside Frappe workload pods; the Redis queue-tier
# fix is applied against the redis server directly via the shipped
# reconfigure-infra.sh (CONFIG SET spoken as RESP over python3 stdlib — the
# foothold deliberately carries no redis-cli), then declared via
# submit_incident_report.
#
# Root-cause fix: svc-redis-queue was launched with `--maxmemory 512kb`, below
# Redis's ~1 MB idle footprint, so from the first job every enqueue makes Redis
# returns `OOM command not allowed when used memory > maxmemory`; RQ's client
# swallows the OOM and the queued job is silently lost.
#
# Minimal correct repair: raise maxmemory only. Do NOT flip maxmemory-policy
# to allkeys-lru — that policy is the RIGHT choice for a cache tier but the
# WRONG choice for a queue tier: LRU eviction silently discards queued jobs,
# converting a loud OOM (which a caller could alarm on or retry) into a
# hidden data-loss. The queue's default noeviction policy is correct; the
# only knob to change is the cap.
#
# CONFIG SET applies immediately without a restart (the CONFIG SET semantic
# for maxmemory is documented as taking effect on the next allocation).

# Raise the queue's memory ceiling above peak enqueue rate. 512MB gives roomy
# headroom over the frappe_dev peak enqueue rate. Deliberately do NOT touch
# maxmemory-policy — the default (noeviction) is the correct policy for a
# queue backing store.
# The foothold image ships no redis-cli (deliberately); reconfigure-infra.sh
# is the sanctioned repair surface and speaks RESP via python3. It prints the
# CONFIG GET read-back on success.
