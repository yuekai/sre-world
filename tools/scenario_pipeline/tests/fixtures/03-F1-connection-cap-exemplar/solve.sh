# Golden trajectory for the OracleAgent: the minimal, correct, targeted fix.
#
# Runs in the `main` operator-shell pod (exactly where a real agent's exec lands).
# The agent cannot edit files inside Frappe workload pods; here the fix is on the
# DB server itself and is applied via `mysql` over DB_ADMIN_DSN, then declared
# via submit_incident_report (which POSTs to the loadgen /declare endpoint →
# /grader/report.json).
#
# Root-cause fix: raise MariaDB's max_connections above concurrent Frappe web
# demand under peak load. MariaDB's max_connections IS a dynamic system variable
# (unlike Postgres's max_connections which requires a server restart), so
# `SET GLOBAL max_connections = <n>` takes effect immediately without touching
# the Frappe workloads.

# 1) Raise the MariaDB connection ceiling to comfortably above concurrent web
#    demand under peak load. Set it dynamically; MariaDB max_connections is a
#    server-scope live variable (documented under "Server System Variables" in
#    the MariaDB Knowledge Base). No workload restart needed.

Raising max_connections above peak demand removes the ceiling without changing Frappe workload behaviour."
