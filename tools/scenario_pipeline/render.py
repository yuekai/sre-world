"""Deterministic renderer: fault record → four scenario files.

Contract (design §S4): the renderer emits ALL structural fields (fault values,
minimality allowlist, thresholds, attribution triple, component_registry).
The LLM authoring pass (:mod:`author`) emits ONLY prose (task.description,
fault.header, ground_truth.mechanism narrative, instruction.md body,
solve.sh header comment, submit_incident_report mechanism sentence).

For Phase 1 (this file), prose fields are populated from ``prose_seeds`` when
present or from a placeholder that will trip S5 if left unrefined. Phase 3
hooks the LLM output in via a ``prose: dict[str, str]`` parameter to
:func:`render`.

The renderer NEVER emits a ``calibration:`` block. That block is bot-written
by ``/calibrate``. ``thresholds.provisional`` is always ``True`` at render.

# Substrate baselines
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The closed component registry for each substrate.
#
# Service tokens are UNDERSCORE-form; hyphens are legal only after the first dot.
# That is HARD INVARIANT H7 (substrates/frappe/contracts/registry.yaml:16-20), and
# it is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: the oracle's ``_canon_token``
# (verifier/oracle/attribution.py:62-77) casefolds, collapses whitespace, and
# strips one leading ``svc-``/``svc_`` — it NEVER rewrites the dotted body. So
# ``redis-queue.capacity`` and ``redis_queue.capacity`` are different identifiers,
# and Gate 2 needs BOTH an exact set match against ground_truth (:242) and
# membership in this registry (:248-251).
#
# These baselines were hyphen-form, which is why they could not express a
# canonical multiword service at all. Worse, the escape hatch was append-only, so
# a record naming ``redis_queue`` rendered a registry holding BOTH spellings —
# membership accepts either, the set match accepts one, and the scenario ships a
# false-negative trap by construction. ``_assert_registry_coherent`` below now
# refuses that shape.
#
# Some shipped frappe scenarios carry hyphen-form DISTRACTORS. They are a known,
# tracked deviation and are deliberately NOT reproduced here: normalizing them in
# place would move grader_fingerprint and qualification_surface_fingerprint and
# void the fence evidence of every calibrated task, buying nothing this rule does
# not buy for free on new work.
#
# Records may add components via ``component_registry.additional_components``;
# they cannot remove or re-order. With a canonical baseline nothing needs
# replacing — 03-QE1's `redis_queue` and `redis_queue.config` are already here,
# so it only ADDS `redis_queue.capacity`.

# and it was the whole reason a new scenario cost a day of hand-authoring. It is
# also overwhelmingly boilerplate: comparing 03-F1's block against 03-U1's, 94 of
# 135 leaves are byte-identical (69%), and almost all of the remainder is
# mechanical — requirement ids derived from a prefix, assert values derived from
# the attribution pair. Only the requirement TEXTS are genuinely per-scenario.
#
# So this is a template with four parameters:
#   prefix      requirement-id namespace, e.g. CONNCAP -> CONNCAP-OUT-1
#   service     attribution.service      (canonical_report_service assert value)
#   component   attribution.component    (canonical_report_component assert value)
#   variable    the mariadb global the fault moves, e.g. max_connections
# plus five prose strings, seeded like every other prose field.
#
# canonical_report_component is deliberately non-optional. Its absence is why
# 03-U1 shipped gradeable-wrong: an agent could name the right service and the
# wrong component and still pass. Rubric item A2 makes it blocking.
