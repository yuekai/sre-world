"""Generation-time gate: an observe: pointer must be able to resolve.

Runs in ``tools/generate_tasks.py`` alongside the timing and values gates and
ships with NO task. That placement is deliberate: anything imported by the
vendored ``contract.py`` joins ``verifier_v2/closure.py``, the closure IS the
grader-semantics surface, and adding to it moves the grader fingerprint of
every task that ships it — invalidating reusable calibration evidence corpus-
wide. The property here is fully decidable from source, so the check costs
nothing at grade time and fires EARLIER, when the task is authored rather
than when it is graded.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A v2 check names the evidence it grades on as ``{artifact, pointer}``. Three
things can go wrong with that pair, and only two were caught:

1. a materializer is DECLARED but nothing consumes it — ``generate_tasks``
   already rejects this;
2. an artifact is CONSUMED but its materializer is not declared — the
   declaration-presence direction;
3. the artifact is declared, produced, and the pointer names a key it never
   emits — nothing caught this.

The third is what shipped in ``06-sends-collapse-and-stay-collapsed``: a check
observed ``derived/legacy-outcome.json`` at ``/checks/data_survival/pass``, a
key that materializer has never emitted. It passed every gate, cost two
calibration runs, and surfaced only as an ``EvidenceError`` inside a live
cluster — the most expensive place to learn it.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT DECIDABLE
----------------------------
Only artifacts whose top-level shape is fixed in source can be checked without
running anything. ``legacy_outcome`` qualifies: ``verifier/oracle/outcome.py``
builds its ``checks`` mapping from a closed set of literals. Others —
``repair-scope.json`` keyed by observed config paths, ``incident-report.json``
keyed by whatever the agent reported — are DATA-DEPENDENT: their keys are not
knowable until a run exists.

The gate therefore covers a named subset and reports the remainder as skipped.
That distinction is the point. A gate that silently passed the undecidable set
would read as coverage while excluding exactly the hard cases — the same defect
shape as diagnostics that omit the failing pod.
