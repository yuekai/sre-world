"""Every module a shipped task bundle imports must be shipped with it.

WHY THIS IS NOT COVERED BY THE DRIFT CHECK
------------------------------------------
`validate.sh smoke` compares the committed task tree against a fresh
`generate_tasks --all`. That proves the generator is REPRODUCIBLE — it emits the
same bytes twice — and says nothing about whether those bytes RUN.

Observed 2026-08-28: adding a module under `verifier/` and importing it
from the already-vendored `contract.py`, without adding it to
`closure.py::_COMMON`, regenerated all 44 tasks with a `contract.py` importing a
file that was never copied alongside it. Grading would have raised ImportError
for every task. Smoke reported **PASS=16 FAIL=0**, because the committed and
regenerated trees were byte-identically wrong.

These two guards are deliberately orthogonal and must fail independently: drift
answers "did the generator change its mind?", this answers "does what we ship
import?".
