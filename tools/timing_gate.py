"""timing_gate — ONE gate for the per-task episode-timing invariants.

Four numbers have to nest for an episode to grade what it claims to grade:

    ready_timeout_sec   cluster + chart bring-up, BEFORE the agent exists
    AGENT_SETUP_S       harbor's own agent-setup phase, still before agent t=0
    agent_timeout_sec   the agent's wall-clock budget
    declare_deadline_s  EPISODE-relative instant after which submit_incident_report
                        returns 409 declaration_deadline_elapsed
    verifier_timeout_sec the grading process's own budget

They were checked piecemeal, so every fix to one broke another. In one night:
raising an agent budget without the deadline (409 on a correct report); copying a
slack-spine deadline onto frappe, whose bring-up offset is larger; leaving a
verifier ceiling below a raised agent budget; and a scenario test pinning a stale
budget. Each person re-derived the arithmetic from scratch.

The invariants, all resolved through the REAL profile chain
(inline overlay -> substrate profiles.yaml -> loadgen-common builtins, via
``substrate._scenario_profiles``) rather than from whatever the spec happens to
restate inline:

  (a) HARD  declare_deadline_s >= agent_timeout_sec + ready_timeout_sec
                                 + AGENT_SETUP_S + declare_margin_s
            (declare_margin_s is an optional task.metadata knob, default 0 — the
             "boundary margin" the frappe and 06-F4 specs describe in prose)
  (b) HARD  verifier_timeout_sec > declare_deadline_s
  (c) warn  a LOOPING profile's declare_deadline_s lands on a cycle boundary
  (d) warn  the derived tests/test.sh poll budget fits inside verifier_timeout_sec

(a) and (b) print every input, the arithmetic, and the exact field to change:
the failure has to explain itself to whoever hits it at 03:00.

AGENT_SETUP_S is 360, harbor's real ``Trial._AGENT_SETUP_TIMEOUT_SEC``
(scenarios/slack-spine/06-F3-split-sequencer/test_06_f3_instruction.py asserts
it). The generator used to assume 300. The old value is still selectable
(``--agent-setup-sec 300`` / ``SRE_WORLD_AGENT_SETUP_SEC``) because the fleet was
sized against 300 and re-sizing it is a separate, calibration-invalidating
decision — see WAIVERS.
